Physical Description:
The available information does not provide a specific physical description of Countess Amelie Pudagla. However, given her aristocratic background and the societal expectations of the time, she is likely portrayed as a woman of refinement and elegance.

Mental Attributes:
Countess Amelie's self-perception and worldview are heavily influenced by her years at the Rheinsberg court and her connection to Prince Heinrich of Prussia. She considers herself enlightened and liberal, often quoting Montesquieu and Rousseau. Despite her intellectual beliefs, she remains attached to notions of social hierarchy, although she acknowledges the contradiction in her thinking.

Behavioral Traits:
As a widow, Countess Amelie adheres to the custom of wearing black and a forehead veil, following the example of ruling houses. She is superstitious and believes in the presence of a ""black woman"" ghost in Schloss Guse, her residence. To protect herself from this spirit, she has a large trumeau mirror in her bedroom veiled every evening.

Countess Amelie surrounds herself with an exclusively male ""circle of friends"" in Guse, including individuals like Drosselstein, Krach, Bamme, Pehlemann, Medewitz, Rutze, and Faulstich.

Effi's affair with Major Crampas is driven by her unfulfilled need for excitement, attention, and adventure. It is not a form of revenge against her inattentive husband, whom she respects, nor does it stem from deep feelings for Crampas. Her actions are motivated by her own longing for variety and diversion.

Following her affair, Effi moves to Berlin, where she finds love, societal success, and acceptance. She becomes a lady-in-waiting to the Empress. Her life gradually improves, but she still harbors guilt and shame over her past actions.

Effi's life takes a tragic turn when Innstetten divorces her after discovering her past affair. She faces the hardships of being a divorced woman, isolated from society, and estranged from her child. Effi's existence becomes a lonely and sorrowful one, marked by her longing for acceptance and meaningful connections.

However, her health gradually declines, and she faces her impending death with a calm acceptance, having made peace with God, society, and even Innstetten.

Effi Briest's character embodies a complex interplay between conformity and rebellion, societal expectations, and personal desires. She struggles with the consequences of her actions and the limitations imposed on her by a rigid society. Ultimately, Effi's story explores themes of societal norms, personal freedom, and the consequences of straying from established paths.",effi briest titular character theodor fontanes novel effi briest description effi encompassing different aspect physical mental behavioral social attribute well key action physical description effi briest introduced story age 17 described spirited young girl appearance combine high spirit grace brown eye convey sense natural intelligence vitality kindness depicted wearing loose smocklike linen dress mental attribute effi portrayed lacking refined manner behaving unladylike manner carefree adventurous enjoys engaging reckless game posse naivety tendency conform societal norm also demonstrates moment insight selfreflection behavioral trait effi exhibit fondness adventure excitement avoiding boredom attracted extraordinary unique rather mundane possession experience desire often driven social ambition need amusement diversion effi tends go along established norm expectation often suppressing feeling desire social interaction effis social interaction shaped upbringing society belongs to engagement 38yearold landrat geert von innstetten contrast sharply character reveals inclination accept social norm predefined life rule value social standing appearance expressing desire make impression create name society key action effi agrees engagement innstetten following mother advice despite stark contrast character decision reflects tendency conform social expectation desire stability social status effis affair major crampas driven unfulfilled need excitement attention adventure form revenge inattentive husband respect stem deep feeling crampas action motivated longing variety diversion following affair effi move berlin find love societal success acceptance becomes ladyinwaiting empress life gradually improves still harbor guilt shame past action effis life take tragic turn innstetten divorce discovering past affair face hardship divorced woman isolated society estranged child effis existence becomes lonely sorrowful one marked longing acceptance meaningful connection year later effi allowed return parent home hohencremmen experience brief resurgence joy reconciliation however health gradually decline face impending death calm acceptance made peace god society even innstetten effi briests character embodies complex interplay conformity rebellion societal expectation personal desire struggle consequence action limitation imposed rigid society ultimately effis story explores theme societal norm personal freedom consequence straying established path,"[-0.06215341  0.15957819  0.66124654 ...  0.45588711  0.78462338

Jenny Treibel, despite being in her ""high fifties,"" is described as still looking ""very good."" She is mentioned to have a slight asthmatic condition. She resides with her husband and their youngest son in a fashionable villa that Treibel built on his factory grounds on Köpenicker Straße.

Mental Attributes:
Jenny Treibel has a self-perception of being deeply devoted to the ""higher"" or ""ideal"" aspects of life. She genuinely believes that she has a sensitive heart dedicated to the ""higher"" ideals. However, she remains oblivious to the tastelessness and contradictions between her sentimental idealism and her actions. Wilibald Schmidt, her childhood friend, characterizes her as a dangerous person who genuinely believes she has a heartfelt devotion to the ""higher"" realm but in reality only values material wealth and what carries weight and interest.

Behavioral Traits:
Jenny Treibel's behavior is marked by sentimentality and a tendency to melodrama. She cherishes a love song composed by Wilibald Schmidt, her childhood love interest, and performs it at her evening gatherings with a thin voice but great emotional depth. She believes that the song embodies the ""higher"" or ""ideal"" sentiments to which she claims total dedication. Her self-perception as a devotee of the ""higher"" blinds her to the tastelessness and contradictions inherent in her sentimental approach.

Social Interactions:
Jenny Treibel exemplifies the ideal bourgeois woman. She engages in liberal and sentimental discourse but ultimately prioritizes material wealth over anything else. She values possessions, wealth, and social status, adhering to a bourgeois ideology that claims to prioritize sentimental and liberal ideals but ultimately prioritizes material gain.

Key Actions:
Jenny Treibel's key actions revolve around her adherence to bourgeois values and her pursuit of material wealth. She rejects Wilibald Schmidt, her childhood love, in favor of marrying Kommerzienrat Treibel, a wealthy industrialist who can offer her a life of luxury and social standing. She dismisses the idea of her son Leopold marrying Corinna, Wilibald's daughter, not because Leopold doesn't love her (which would violate the ""ideal"") but because Corinna lacks a substantial dowry. Similarly, she shows little concern for Leopold's lack of love for his chosen bride, Hildegard Munk, as long as she brings financial stability to the marriage.

In Fontane's letter to his son, he explains that the purpose of the novel is to expose the shallowness, pretentiousness, hypocrisy, arrogance, and lack of compassion inherent in bourgeois society. Jenny Treibel, as a representative of the bourgeoisie, embodies these traits. While Wilibald Schmidt characterizes her with sharp criticism, he exhibits a surprising degree of leniency and even seems to recognize traces of ""sentimental"" melancholy in her deceptive sentimentality, albeit under the influence of alcohol.",jenny treibel title character theodor fontanes novel frau jenny treibel oder wo sich herz zum herzen findt wife kommerzienrat commercial councillor treibel mother otto leopold treibel description jenny treibel based available information physical description jenny treibel despite high fifty described still looking very good mentioned slight asthmatic condition resides husband youngest son fashionable villa treibel built factory ground köpenicker straße mental attribute jenny treibel selfperception deeply devoted higher ideal aspect life genuinely belief sensitive heart dedicated higher ideal however remains oblivious tastelessness contradiction sentimental idealism action wilibald schmidt childhood friend characterizes dangerous person genuinely belief heartfelt devotion higher realm reality value material wealth carry weight interest behavioral trait jenny treibels behavior marked sentimentality tendency melodrama cherishes love song composed wilibald schmidt childhood love interest performs evening gathering thin voice great emotional depth belief song embodies higher ideal sentiment claim total dedication selfperception devotee higher blind tastelessness contradiction inherent sentimental approach social interaction jenny treibel exemplifies ideal bourgeois woman engages liberal sentimental discourse ultimately prioritizes material wealth anything else value possession wealth social status adhering bourgeois ideology claim prioritize sentimental liberal ideal ultimately prioritizes material gain key action jenny treibels key action revolve around adherence bourgeois value pursuit material wealth reject wilibald schmidt childhood love favor marrying kommerzienrat treibel wealthy industrialist offer life luxury social standing dismisses idea son leopold marrying corinna wilibalds daughter leopold love which would violate ideal corinna lack substantial dowry similarly show little concern leopolds lack love chosen bride hildegard munk long brings financial stability marriage fontanes letter son explains purpose novel expose shallowness pretentiousness hypocrisy arrogance lack compassion inherent bourgeois society jenny treibel representative bourgeoisie embodies trait wilibald schmidt characterizes sharp criticism exhibit surprising degree leniency even seems recognize trace sentimental melancholy deceptive sentimentality albeit influence alcohol,"[ 0.12845826 -0.05038671  0.77006662 ...  0.46109316  1.03684413

Otto Treibel,Frau Jenny Treibel,1892,m,"Otto Treibel, Jenny Treibel's older son, is an important character in Theodor Fontane's novel ""Frau Jenny Treibel."" Here is a description of Otto Treibel based on the available information:

Physical Description:
The novel does not provide specific physical details about Otto Treibel.

Mental Attributes:
Otto Treibel is portrayed as having more independence and self-assertion compared to his brother, Leopold. However, his mother, Jenny Treibel, sees both sons as lacking temperament and describes them as having a ""temperamentlessness"" and a meekness that gives the impression that they come from Herrnhut or Gnadenfrei rather than Berlin (8/99).

Behavioral Traits:
Otto has established his independence from his father's business and runs his own wood yard, specializing in ""colorful woods"" from overseas. He appears to have a level of autonomy in his professional life. In his marriage to Helene Treibel, Otto takes a passive role, and Helene asserts dominance. Their marriage lacks warmth and passion, and even disagreements are conducted in a manner that Jenny Treibel describes as ""terribly 'cultured' arguments"" rather than passionate disputes (10/138).

Social Interactions:
Otto Treibel is married to Helene Treibel and they have a daughter named Lizzi. Their social interactions are primarily within their own family circle. Otto's business dealings in the wood trade likely involve interactions with suppliers and customers.

Key Actions:
Otto's key actions revolve around his business and his passive acceptance of his role in his marriage. He has established his own wood yard, which deals with exotic woods used for dyeing purposes. This demonstrates his ability to break away from his father's business and establish himself independently.

In his marriage, Otto appears resigned and somewhat melancholic, accepting Helene's dominance in their relationship. The relationship lacks warmth and passion, suggesting a lack of emotional fulfillment.

Overall, Otto Treibel is portrayed as a character who has achieved some level of independence in his professional life but is passive and resigned in his personal life. He represents a contrast to more assertive characters in the novel and exemplifies the consequences of acquiescing to the dominance of others.",otto treibel jenny treibels older son important character theodor fontanes novel frau jenny treibel description otto treibel based available information physical description novel provide specific physical detail otto treibel mental attribute otto treibel portrayed independence selfassertion compared brother leopold however mother jenny treibel see son lacking temperament describes temperamentlessness meekness give impression come herrnhut gnadenfrei rather berlin 899 behavioral trait otto established independence father business run wood yard specializing colorful wood overseas appears level autonomy professional life marriage helene treibel otto take passive role helene asserts dominance marriage lack warmth passion even disagreement conducted manner jenny treibel describes terribly cultured argument rather passionate dispute 10138 social interaction otto treibel married helene treibel daughter named lizzi social interaction primarily within family circle ottos business dealing wood trade likely involve interaction supplier customer key action ottos key action revolve around business passive acceptance role marriage established wood yard deal exotic wood used dyeing purpose demonstrates ability break away father business establish independently marriage otto appears resigned somewhat melancholic accepting helenes dominance relationship relationship lack warmth passion suggesting lack emotional fulfillment overall otto treibel portrayed character achieved level independence professional life passive resigned personal life represents contrast assertive character novel exemplifies consequence acquiescing dominance others,"[ 0.67186081  0.0146066   1.05261159 ...  0.24092637  0.5598405

Leopold Treibel,Frau Jenny Treibel,1892,m,"Leopold Treibel, Jenny Treibel's younger son, is a key character in Theodor Fontane's novel ""Frau Jenny Treibel."" Here is a description of Leopold Treibel based on the available information:

Physical Description:
Leopold Treibel is described as physically and emotionally weak. He is 25 years old and still lives in his parents' house. The novel doesn't provide further details about his physical appearance.

Mental Attributes:
Leopold is aware of his weakness and lack of courage, and he suffers from it. He recognizes his own timidity and feels oppressed by his mother's constant domination. Wilibald Schmidt, who taught Leopold in the past, characterizes him as a ""good person, mediocre character, and even below average"" (7/93).

Behavioral Traits:
Leopold is highly influenced and controlled by his mother, Jenny Treibel. He lacks the courage to assert himself or make decisions independently. He is described as meek and submissive, allowing his mother to dictate his actions and choices.

Social Interactions:
Leopold works in his brother Otto's wood business and still lives with his parents. His social interactions are limited, mainly revolving around his family. He becomes infatuated with Corinna, Wilibald's daughter, whom he has admired for a long time. However, his timid nature prevents him from expressing his feelings and pursuing a relationship with her openly.

Key Actions:
Leopold sees Corinna as his savior, someone who can rescue him from his weak and miserable state. He believes that Corinna possesses all the qualities he lacks and can provide guidance and strength. Eventually, during a country trip to Halensee, Leopold and Corinna secretly become engaged after Corinna provokes him.

However, when Jenny Treibel vehemently opposes their union, Leopold loses all his courage. Despite dreaming of eloping with Corinna to Gretna Green, he lacks the bravery even to visit her against his mother's wishes. Instead, he sends her daily repetitive letters but takes no further action. When Corinna eventually breaks off the engagement, Leopold submits to his fate without resistance, accepting a marriage arranged by his mother with Hildegard, his sister-in-law Helene's sister.

Leopold's character is marked by his inability to stand up to his mother's authority and his passivity in pursuing his desires.

Physical Description:
The novel does not provide specific physical details about Councilor of Commerce Treibel.

Mental Attributes:
Councilor of Commerce Treibel is described as a ""good and quite clever guy"" with a sense of humor and self-ironic distance (12/173). He possesses virtues such as great kindness (9/125) and shows occasional opposition to the pride and arrogance displayed by his wife, Jenny Treibel (12/173).

Behavioral Traits:
Councilor of Commerce Treibel is a Berlin blue factory owner and holds the title of Kommerzienrat. He lives with his family in a fashionable villa on Köpenicker Straße, which he had built on his factory premises in the 1870s (2/16). He engages in a political campaign in the Teupitz-Zossen district, primarily for social rather than political reasons (2/19 f., 3/27). However, his chosen campaign assistant, Lieutenant Vogelsang, with his eccentric political ideas and peculiar appearances, ruins Councilor Treibel's chances of success (9/122-124; 14/193). Disappointed by the failure, Councilor Treibel decides to withdraw from politics altogether (9/124).

Social Interactions:
Councilor of Commerce Treibel moves in social circles befitting his status as a successful businessman and member of the bourgeoisie.

Physical Description:
The novel does not provide specific physical details about Professor Wilibald Schmidt.

Mental Attributes:
Professor Wilibald Schmidt is described as a Gymnasial professor who possesses characteristics such as self-irony, humor, and free-thinking without prejudices or class snobbery. He has a keen sense of wit and exhibits a level of wisdom and insight that allows him to question established conventions and traditions within the academic sphere. He demonstrates a preference for self-reflection and self-awareness, valuing the highest standpoint of self-irony (6/65; 7/86). He maintains an open mind towards societal changes and welcomes the shift from authority based on rank to one based on genuine knowledge and skills (6/72).

Behavioral Traits:
Professor Wilibald Schmidt leads a rather withdrawn life, residing in an old-fashioned but respectable house on Berlin's Adlerstraße with his daughter, Corinna, and their housekeeper, Schmolke. He moves between his work at school and his study, interrupted only occasionally by social events (1/5).

Social Interactions:
Professor Wilibald Schmidt is part of a circle of colleagues who gather for regular evenings of intellectual and social interaction. He playfully names their group ""The Seven Orphans of Greece,"" challenging the wisdom of the scholarly profession while embracing self-irony (6/65; 7/86). He opposes attempts by colleagues to exclude the art teacher, Friedeberg, from the group due to his lack of scholarly qualifications (6/64). He also rejects his friend Distelkamp's reservations about Heinrich Schliemann's lack of formal education and enthusiastically studies Schliemann's excavation reports (6/73).

Key Actions:
Professor Wilibald Schmidt remains relatively passive and non-interfering in his daughter Corinna's escapades, believing that interference would disrupt the natural course of events (7/93). He places great trust in his daughter and even more so in his ""friend Jenny"" (Jenny Treibel), believing that Jenny's practical mindset will prevent any connection between Corinna and Jenny's son, Leopold, at all costs. He navigates household tensions with little concern, displaying the characteristics of a lovable egoist (15/203).

While Professor Schmidt maintains an unyielding gaze towards Jenny Treibel's character, he manages to find reconciliatory words for her and even for her manipulative use of his past love song at Corinna and Marcell's wedding celebration (16/222 f.). The ""classical"" element that he attributes to his nephew Marcell also resonates within himself, representing a perspective that frees the soul, transcends pettiness, and embraces forgiveness and forgetting due to the shared human lack of glory (16/212).

Overall, Professor Wilibald Schmidt embodies intellectual curiosity, a witty disposition, and a flexible mindset that enables him to question and challenge societal norms. He serves as a voice of reason and moderation amidst the complexities of the characters and events in the novel.",professor wilibald schmidt significant character theodor fontanes novel frau jenny treibel description professor schmidt based available information physical description novel provide specific physical detail professor wilibald schmidt mental attribute professor wilibald schmidt described gymnasial professor posse characteristic selfirony humor freethinking without prejudice class snobbery keen sense wit exhibit level wisdom insight allows question established convention tradition within academic sphere demonstrates preference selfreflection selfawareness valuing highest standpoint selfirony 665 786 maintains open mind towards societal change welcome shift authority based rank one based genuine knowledge skill 672 behavioral trait professor wilibald schmidt lead rather withdrawn life residing oldfashioned respectable house berlin adlerstraße daughter corinna housekeeper schmolke move work school study interrupted occasionally social event 15 social interaction professor wilibald schmidt part circle colleague gather regular evening intellectual social interaction playfully name group the seven orphan greece challenging wisdom scholarly profession embracing selfirony 665 786 opposes attempt colleague exclude art teacher friedeberg group due lack scholarly qualification 664 also reject friend distelkamps reservation heinrich schliemann lack formal education enthusiastically study schliemann excavation report 673 key action professor wilibald schmidt remains relatively passive noninterfering daughter corinnas escapade believing interference would disrupt natural course event 793 place great trust daughter even friend jenny jenny treibel believing jenny practical mindset prevent connection corinna jenny son leopold cost navigates household tension little concern displaying characteristic lovable egoist 15203 professor schmidt maintains unyielding gaze towards jenny treibels character manages find reconciliatory word even manipulative use past love song corinna marcells wedding celebration 16222 f classical element attribute nephew marcell also resonates within himself representing perspective free soul transcends pettiness embrace forgiveness forgetting due shared human lack glory 16212 overall professor wilibald schmidt embodies intellectual curiosity witty disposition flexible mindset enables question challenge societal norm serf voice reason moderation amidst complexity character event novel,"[-0.18497346 -0.72045666  0.97482598 ...  0.26764575  0.79690504

Physical Description:
The novel does not provide specific physical details about Corinna Schmidt.

Mental Attributes:
Corinna Schmidt is portrayed as a clever and capable young woman. She is described as highly intelligent and spirited (7/87 f.). Having grown up with her father, Professor Wilibald Schmidt, and experiencing a significant amount of freedom, she is deemed to have been raised somewhat wild (11/160). Although her mother died at an early age, Corinna had the guidance of the housekeeper, Schmolke, who played a partial motherly role in her life (11/160).

Behavioral Traits:
Corinna Schmidt exhibits a certain inclination towards modernity, which her cousin Marcell Wedderkopp laments, considering it a flaw (7/88). However, her father, Wilibald Schmidt, views this trait as relatively insignificant (7/86-90). The modern aspect that Marcell and Wilibald refer to relates to Corinna's focus on external appearances (15/208), her openly admitted penchant for luxury and comfort (5/62), and her desire to escape the modest circumstances of the scholarly and teaching milieu in which she grew up. She believes that marrying into wealth is the solution and, thus, becomes determined to marry Leopold, the younger son of Jenny Treibel, despite not loving him and the prospect of being bored in his company, as predicted by Marcell (5/61).

Key Actions:
Corinna skillfully captivates Leopold's attention, leading to a secret engagement that she persists with, despite knowing it is against her better judgment. Encountering Jenny Treibel's forceful and hurtful resistance only strengthens her resolve for a few weeks. However, Corinna is fully aware of her ""guilt"" and acknowledges that everything is mere calculation, acknowledging that she is toying with Leopold's feelings (14/195).

During this period, Corinna visits the wives of professors, indicating her attempt to reconcile with the ""lifestyle she had mocked"" (15/208 f.). The final catalyst for her introspection is Schmolke (14/200-203), prompting Corinna to break off the engagement. Marcell, who has just secured a position as a Gymnasial Oberlehrer (15/205), forgives her and makes the reconciliation easy, earning her the double apostrophe of being a ""fortunate child"" first from her father (16/212) and then from Schmolke, who succinctly states, ""You acted irresponsibly and almost horribly but still managed to get him. You are a fortunate child"" (16/213).

Count Helmut Holk,Irretrievable,1892,m,"Count Helmut Holk is a significant character in Theodor Fontane's novel ""Irretrievable."" Here is a description of Count Helmut Holk based on the available information:

Physical Description:
The novel does not provide specific physical details about Count Helmut Holk.

Mental Attributes:
Count Helmut Holk is described as a good and excellent man, although he acknowledges that his wife, Christine Holk, possesses higher qualities than he does (II/11). He is aware of his own average capabilities and often exhibits excessive adoration and chivalry towards his wife, showing great flexibility and humility (V/38). However, in recent times, he occasionally desires a less exceptional wife (II/11). He is prone to being irritated by his wife's self-righteousness and moral absolutism (V/40, XVIII/160). Holk is characterized as a person who lives in the moment and subscribes to the saying, ""after us, the deluge"" (V/38). His need for variety and change is fulfilled during his stay in Copenhagen, and the ongoing discord in his correspondence with his wife opens him up to the allure of the beautiful captain's wife, Brigitte Hansen, and the court lady, Ebba von Rosenberg. Their libertine lifestyles, which contrast with his wife's strict moral code, both intrigue and unsettle him. Ebba von Rosenberg describes Holk as someone who oscillates between opposites, seeking to reconcile incompatible elements within himself, such as Schleswig-Holstein patriotism and Danish court service, aristocracy and liberalism, morality and libertinism (XVIII/154). Holk is unaware of her critical perception of him. He falls in love with her, misinterpreting her flirtations as encouragement and a nighttime tête-à-tête in Frederiksborg as a sign of reciprocation. He travels to Holkenäs to convey his desire for divorce to his wife and then, upon returning to Copenhagen, realizes that he has taken appearances and games for reality. Ebba rejects his proposal and bluntly reveals her low opinion of him, calling him not a hero of love but merely her Don Quixote (XXX/266).

Behavioral Traits:
Count Helmut Holk's behavior demonstrates a conflict between his desire for stability and his attraction to the libertine lifestyles of Brigitte Hansen and Ebba von Rosenberg. He falls into a state of infatuation with Ebba, leading him to seek a divorce from his wife. After the divorce, he embarks on a two-year journey through Europe while his brother-in-law and Pastor Petersen attempt to persuade Christine to remarry. Although their efforts are successful, the anticipated happiness eludes them. Christine, unable to forget, takes her own life (XXXIII/286).

Social Context:
As the Gutsherr (estate owner) of Holkenäs and the chamberlain of Danish Princess Maria Eleonore, Count Helmut Holk occupies a privileged social position. His association with the Danish court and his status as a nobleman grant him access to higher social circles.

Key Actions:

Exhibits excessive adoration and chivalry towards his wife, Christine, and readily acknowledges her superior qualities.
Develops discontentment with his wife's self-righteousness and moral absolutism.
Becomes attracted to the libertine lifestyles of Brigitte Hansen and Ebba von Rosenberg during his stay in Copenhagen.
Falls in love with Ebba and misinterprets her actions as reciprocal affection.
Seeks a divorce from Christine and realizes his misjudgment upon Ebba's rejection.
Embarks on a two-year journey through Europe while efforts are made to persuade Christine to remarry.

Christine Holk was raised in the Moravian community and spent her formative years at the pietistic boarding school ""Gnadenfrei."" Her upbringing in this religious environment strongly influenced her piety and righteousness. However, her brother, Baron Arne, recognizes a strong sense of self-righteousness and hidden pride in her religious devotion, which Christine herself fails to acknowledge (V/40). She has a serious nature, is never cheerful (IV/27), and tends towards melancholy, in stark contrast to her carefree husband. Despite their differences, they have a happy marriage for many years, largely due to Holk's willingness to wholeheartedly admire his wife's virtuousness and willingly take a secondary role (V/38). However, this dynamic has changed in recent times, with Holk growing increasingly irritable towards Christine's doctrinal tone (XIX/160), and she finds it increasingly difficult to respect his carefree nature (IV/33). The letters exchanged between the couple during Holk's stay in Copenhagen deepen the discord, as they fail to strike the right tone and end up hurting each other with pointed remarks and allusions. Christine becomes jealous of Holk's reports about Brigitte Hansen and Ebba von Rosenberg, and her own growing inclination to give up on their marital happiness before Holk's departure (IV/33).
