René Cardillac,Mademoiselle de Scuderi,1819,m,"René Cardillac is the main character in E.T.A. Hoffmann's novel ""Mademoiselle de Scuderi."" He is described as the ""most skilled goldsmith in Paris,"" and is also the elusive jewelry thief and murderer that the Parisian police believe to be part of a criminal gang.

Physically, Cardillac is described as being ""rather small than tall, but broad-shouldered and with a strong, muscular build."" Despite being in his late fifties, he remains agile and powerful, emphasized by his ""thick, frizzy, reddish hair"" that adds to his imposing presence. His appearance generally paints him as an honorable and selfless man, always ready to help others, but his ""peculiar gaze from small, deep-set, green-gleaming eyes"" sets him apart and could raise suspicion of hidden malice.

Socially, Cardillac is known as one of the ""strangest people of his time"" because he takes on commissions for significantly lower pay than he deserves. Once he completes the jewelry, however, he becomes unwilling to part with it. He has a selected group of clients from whom he refuses to accept orders, and among them is the Marquise de Maintenon. Unbeknownst to others, Cardillac does this to protect their lives. The details of his history and motives are revealed only after his death, in the report given to Mademoiselle de Scuderi by his apprentice, Olivier Brußon.

Cardillac's key actions in the story involve a pattern of committing murders after reluctantly parting with a piece of jewelry. Whenever he relinquishes a piece, he is haunted by his ""evil star"" and compelled not only to retrieve the jewelry but also to kill its owner. He employs a secret entrance and exit in his house to escape pursuit, notably eluding Desgrais, who relentlessly pursues him during his thieving and killing sprees.

When Cardillac discovers a relationship developing between his daughter Madelon and Olivier Brußon, he throws the young man out of his house. However, when Brußon becomes a witness to one of his murders, Cardillac rehires him and promises him Madelon's hand in marriage, thereby silencing him.

Cardillac's descent into madness is traced back to an eerie incident during his mother's pregnancy involving a ""cavalier in Spanish clothing with a sparkling jewel chain,"" which supposedly impacted him even before birth. As a child, he was obsessively drawn to jewelry, especially precious stones, leading him to pursue the career of a goldsmith. Eventually, he started hearing voices commanding him to commit the murders, haunting him throughout his life.

Later in the story, Cardillac becomes anxious that the ""murderous specter"" might target Mademoiselle de Scuderi after he sends her an exquisite piece of jewelry as a sign of respect and gratitude. To protect her, Brußon follows Cardillac at night to safeguard the elderly lady. However, Cardillac attacks the Count of Miossens, who is prepared for the assault, and is fatally wounded in self-defense. Before dying, Cardillac brings the hands of the betrothed couple, Brußon and Madelon, together with a soulful gaze and a fervent grip.

Throughout the novel, René Cardillac is portrayed as a complex character with conflicting traits. He is both a highly skilled artisan and a ruthless killer, torn between his passion for crafting jewelry and the dark compulsion to take lives, driven by an inexplicable force tied to his mysterious past."
