Similarly, she shows little concern for Leopold's lack of love for his chosen bride, Hildegard Munk, as long as she brings financial stability to the marriage.

In Fontane's letter to his son, he explains that the purpose of the novel is to expose the shallowness, pretentiousness, hypocrisy, arrogance, and lack of compassion inherent in bourgeois society.

Physical Description:
The novel does not provide specific physical details about Corinna Schmidt.

Having grown up with her father, Professor Wilibald Schmidt, and experiencing a significant amount of freedom, she is deemed to have been raised somewhat wild (11/160). Although her mother died at an early age, Corinna had the guidance of the housekeeper, Schmolke, who played a partial motherly role in her life (11/160).

Behavioral Traits:
Corinna Schmidt exhibits a certain inclination towards modernity, which her cousin Marcell Wedderkopp laments, considering it a flaw (7/88). However, her father, Wilibald Schmidt, views this trait as relatively insignificant (7/86-90). The modern aspect that Marcell and Wilibald refer to relates to Corinna's focus on external appearances (15/208), her openly admitted penchant for luxury and comfort (5/62), and her desire to escape the modest circumstances of the scholarly and teaching milieu in which she grew up. She believes that marrying into wealth is the solution and, thus, becomes determined to marry Leopold, the younger son of Jenny Treibel, despite not loving him and the prospect of being bored in his company, as predicted by Marcell (5/61).

Key Actions:
Corinna skillfully captivates Leopold's attention, leading to a secret engagement that she persists with, despite knowing it is against her better judgment. Encountering Jenny Treibel's forceful and hurtful resistance only strengthens her resolve for a few weeks. However, Corinna is fully aware of her ""guilt"" and acknowledges that everything is mere calculation, acknowledging that she is toying with Leopold's feelings (14/195).

During this period, Corinna visits the wives of professors, indicating her attempt to reconcile with the ""lifestyle she had mocked"" (15/208 f.). The final catalyst for her introspection is Schmolke (14/200-203), prompting Corinna to break off the engagement. Marcell, who has just secured a position as a Gymnasial Oberlehrer (15/205), forgives her and makes the reconciliation easy, earning her the double apostrophe of being a ""fortunate child"" first from her father (16/212) and then from Schmolke, who succinctly states, ""You acted irresponsibly and almost horribly but still managed to get him. You are a fortunate child"" (16/213). Two days later, the engagement announcement appears, and the novel concludes with their wedding celebration."
