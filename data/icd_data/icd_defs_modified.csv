Disease,Description,Essential_Features
Disorders of intellectual development,"Disorders of intellectual development are a group of etiologically diverse conditions originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately two or more standard deviations below the mean (approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests. Where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development requires greater reliance on clinical judgment based on appropriate assessment of comparable behavioural indicators.","The presence of significant limitations in intellectual functioning across various domains such as perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed, and verbal comprehension. There is often substantial variability in the extent to which any of these domains are affected in an individual. Whenever possible, performance should be measured using appropriately normed, standardized tests of intellectual functioning and found to be approximately 2 or more standard deviations below the mean (i.e., approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile). In situations where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning requires greater reliance on clinical judgment based on appropriate evidence and assessment, which may include the use of behavioural indicators of intellectual functioning (see Table 6.1).
The presence of significant limitations in adaptive behaviour, which refers to the set of conceptual, social, and practical skills that have been learned and are performed by people in their everyday lives. Conceptual skills are those that involve the application of knowledge (e.g., reading, writing, calculating, solving problems, and making decisions) and communication; social skills include managing interpersonal interactions and relationships, social responsibility, following rules and obeying laws, as well as avoiding victimization; and practical skills are involved in areas such as self-care, health and safety, occupational skills, recreation, use of money, mobility and transportation, as well as use of home appliances and technological devices. Expectations of adaptive functioning may change in response to environmental demands that change with age. Whenever possible, performance should be measured with appropriately normed, standardized tests of adaptive behaviour and the total score found to be approximately 2 or more standard deviations below the mean (i.e., approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile). In situations where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, assessment of adaptive behaviour functioning requires greater reliance on clinical judgment based on appropriate assessment, which may include the use of behavioural indicators of adaptive behaviour skills (see Tables 6.2 through 6.4).
Onset occurs during the developmental period. Among adults with Disorders of Intellectual Development who come to clinical attention without a previous diagnosis, it is possible to establish developmental onset through the person’s history, i.e., retrospective diagnosis."
Developmental speech or language disorders,"Developmental speech or language disorders arise during the developmental period and are characterised by difficulties in understanding or producing speech and language or in using language in context for the purposes of communication that are outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. The observed speech and language problems are not attributable to regional, social, or cultural/ethnic language variations and are not fully explained by anatomical or neurological abnormalities. The presumptive aetiology for Developmental speech or language disorders is complex, and in many individual cases, is unknown.","Persistent difficulties in understanding or producing speech or language or in using language in context for the purposes of communication that are not better accounted for by Developmental Speech Sound Disorder, Developmental Speech Fluency Disorder, Developmental Language Disorder, or Autism Spectrum Disorder.
The speech or language difficulties are persistent over time.
The onset of the speech or language difficulties occurs during the developmental period and speech or language abilities in the affected areas are markedly below what would be expected for age.
The speech or language difficulties result in significant impairment in social communication, or in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
The speech or language difficulties are not better accounted for by a Disorder of Intellectual Development, a Disease of the Nervous System, a sensory impairment, or a structural abnormality."
Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual’s age and sociocultural context. The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are sufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are usually a pervasive feature of the individual’s functioning observable in all settings, although they may vary according to social, educational, or other context. Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a full range of intellectual functioning and language abilities.","Persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions that are outside the expected range of typical functioning given the individual’s age and level of intellectual development. Specific manifestations of these deficits vary according to chronological age, verbal and intellectual ability, and disorder severity. Manifestations may include limitations in the following:
Understanding of, interest in, or inappropriate responses to the verbal or non-verbal social communications of others.
Integration of spoken language with typical complimentary non-verbal cues, such as eye contact, gestures, facial expressions and body language. These non-verbal behaviours may also be reduced in frequency or intensity.
Understanding and use of language in social contexts and ability to initiate and sustain reciprocal social conversations.
Social awareness, leading to behaviour that is not appropriately modulated according to the social context.
Ability to imagine and respond to the feelings, emotional states, and attitudes of others.
Mutual sharing of interests.
Ability to make and sustain typical peer relationships.
Persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual’s age and sociocultural context. These may include:
Lack of adaptability to new experiences and circumstances, with associated distress, that can be evoked by trivial changes to a familiar environment or in response to unanticipated events.
Inflexible adherence to particular routines; for example, these may be geographic such as following familiar routes, or may require precise timing such as mealtimes or transport.
Excessive adherence to rules (e.g., when playing games).
Excessive and persistent ritualized patterns of behaviour (e.g., preoccupation with lining up or sorting objects in a particular way) that serve no apparent external purpose.
Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements, such as whole body movements (e.g., rocking), atypical gait (e.g., walking on tiptoes), unusual hand or finger movements and posturing. These behaviours are particularly common during early childhood.
Persistent preoccupation with one or more special interests, parts of objects, or specific types of stimuli (including media) or an unusually strong attachment to particular objects (excluding typical comforters).
Lifelong excessive and persistent hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli or unusual interest in a sensory stimulus, which may include actual or anticipated sounds, light, textures (especially clothing and food), odors and tastes, heat, cold, or pain.
The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood, but characteristic symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities.
The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder are able to function adequately in many contexts through exceptional effort, such that their deficits may not be apparent to others. A diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is still appropriate in such cases.
"
Developmental learning disorder,"Developmental learning disorder is characterised by significant and persistent difficulties in learning academic skills, which may include reading, writing, or arithmetic. The individual’s performance in the affected academic skill(s) is markedly below what would be expected for chronological age and general level of intellectual functioning, and results in significant impairment in the individual’s academic or occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder first manifests when academic skills are taught during the early school years. Developmental learning disorder is not due to a disorder of intellectual development, sensory impairment (vision or hearing), neurological or motor disorder, lack of availability of education, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or psychosocial adversity.","The presence of significant limitations in learning academic skills of reading, writing, or arithmetic, resulting in a skill level markedly below what would be expected for age. Limitations in learning are manifest despite appropriate academic instruction in the relevant areas. The limitations may be restricted to a single component of a skill (e.g., an inability to master basic numeracy, or to decode single words accurately and fluently) or affect all of reading, writing and arithmetic. Ideally, limitations are measured using appropriately normed and standardized tests.
Onset of the limitations typically occurs during the early school years, but in some individuals may not be identified until later in life, including into adulthood, when performance demands related to learning exceed limited capacities.
The limitations are not attributable to external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, or lack of access to educational opportunities.
The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by a Disorder of Intellectual Development or another Neurodevelopmental Disorder or another condition such as a motor disorder or a sensory disorder of vision or hearing.
The learning difficulties result in significant impairment in the individual’s academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Developmental motor coordination disorder,"Developmental motor coordination disorder is characterised by a significant delay in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills and impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness, or inaccuracy of motor performance. Coordinated motor skills are markedly below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g. in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities). Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not solely attributable to a Disease of the Nervous System, Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, sensory impairment, and not better explained by a Disorder of Intellectual Development.","Significant delay in the acquisition of gross or fine motor skills and impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills manifesting as clumsiness, slowness, or inaccuracy of motor performance.
Coordinated motor skills are markedly below that expected on the basis of age.
Onset of coordinated motor skill difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood.
Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in activities of daily living, school work, vocation and leisure activities, or other important areas of functioning.
Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not are not better accounted for by a Disease of the Nervous System, Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, sensory impairment, or a Disorder of Intellectual Development."
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern (at least 6 months) of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning. There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication.","A persistent pattern (e.g., at least 6 months) of inattention symptoms and/or a combination of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms that is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual development. Symptoms vary according to chronological age and disorder severity.
Inattention
Several symptoms of inattention that are persistent, and sufficiently severe that they have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters:
Difficulty sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or reward or require sustained mental effort; lacking attention to detail; making careless mistakes in school or work assignments; not completing tasks.
Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli or thoughts not related to the task at hand; often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly; frequently appears to be daydreaming or to have mind elsewhere.
Loses things; is forgetful in daily activities; has difficulty remembering to complete upcoming daily tasks or activities; difficulty planning, managing and organizing schoolwork, tasks and other activities.
Note: Inattention may not be evident when the individual is engaged in activities that provide intense stimulation and frequent rewards.

Hyperactivity impulsivity
Several symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity that are persistent, and sufficiently severe that they have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning. These tend to be most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters:

Excessive motor activity; leaves seat when expected to sit still; often runs about; has difficulty sitting still without fidgeting (younger children); feelings of physical restlessness, a sense of discomfort with being quiet or sitting still (adolescents and adults).
Difficulty engaging in activities quietly; talks too much.
Blurts out answers in school, comments at work; difficulty waiting turn in conversation, games, or activities; interrupts or intrudes on others conversations or games.
A tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli without deliberation or consideration of risks and consequences (e.g., engaging in behaviours with potential for physical injury; impulsive decisions; reckless driving)
Evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later in adolescence or as adults, often when demands exceed the individual’s capacity to compensate for limitations.

Manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting.

Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety or Fear-Related Disorder, a Neurocognitive Disorder such as Delirium).

Symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or medication (e.g., bronchodilators, thyroid replacement medication) on the central nervous system, including and withdrawal effects, and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System.
"
Stereotyped movement disorder,"Stereotyped movement disorder is characterised by the persistent (e.g., lasting several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period, are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal), and markedly interfere with normal activities or result in self-inflicted bodily injury. Stereotyped movements that are non-injurious can include body rocking, head rocking, finger-flicking mannerisms, and hand flapping. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviours can include repetitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of the hands, lips, or other body parts.","Persistent (e.g., lasting several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless, and often rhythmic, movements (e.g., body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking, and hand biting) that are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal).
Stereotyped movements result in significant interference with the ability to engage in normal daily activities or result in self-inflicted bodily injury severe enough to be an independent focus of clinical attention or that would result in self-injury if protective measures were not taken.
Onset occurs during the developmental period, typically at an early age."
Neurodevelopmental syndrome due to prenatal alcohol exposure,"A syndrome that involves significant neurodevelopmental features that are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention but that do not fulfill the diagnostic requirements of any of the specific Neurodevelopmental disorders and is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure, based on evidence from the history and physical examination.",
Secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome,"A syndrome that involves significant neurodevelopmental features that do not fulfill the diagnostic requirements of any of the specific neurodevelopmental disorders that is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders (e.g., autistic-like features in Retts syndrome; aggression and self-mutilation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, abnormalities in language development in Williams syndrome), based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings.

This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the neurodevelopmental problems are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.","The presence of significant difficulties arising during the developmental period in the acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor coordination, or social functions that do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements of Disorders of Intellectual Development, Autism Spectrum Disorder, or Stereotyped Movement Disorder and persist substantially beyond the expected age.

The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition with onset during the developmental period, based on evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. This judgment depends on establishing that:

The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms;
The course of developmental difficulties (e.g., onset, remission, response of the neurodevelopmental symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition; and
The symptoms are not better accounted for by a Neurodevelopmental Disorder (e.g., a Disorders of Intellectual Development, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Developmental Motor Coordination Disorder) or the effects of a medication or substance.
The symptoms are a specific focus of clinical attention."
Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is characterised by disturbances in multiple mental modalities, including thinking (e.g., delusions, disorganisation in the form of thought), perception (e.g., hallucinations), self-experience (e.g., the experience that one's feelings, impulses, thoughts, or behaviour are under the control of an external force), cognition (e.g., impaired attention, verbal memory, and social cognition), volition (e.g., loss of motivation), affect (e.g., blunted emotional expression), and behaviour (e.g., behaviour that appears bizarre or purposeless, unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses that interfere with the organisation of behaviour). Psychomotor disturbances, including catatonia, may be present. Persistent delusions, persistent hallucinations, thought disorder, and experiences of influence, passivity, or control are considered core symptoms. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one month in order for a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be assigned. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another health condition (e.g., a brain tumour) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g., alcohol withdrawal).","At least two of the following symptoms must be present (by the individual’s report or through observation by the clinician or other informants) most of the time for a period of 1 month or more. At least one of the qualifying symptoms should be from item a) through d) below:
Persistent delusions (e.g., grandiose delusions, delusions of reference, persecutory delusions).

Persistent hallucinations (most commonly auditory, although they may be in any sensory modality).

Disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder) (e.g., tangentiality and loose associations, irrelevant speech, neologisms). When severe, the person’s speech may be so incoherent as to be incomprehensible (‘word salad’).

Experiences of influence, passivity or control (i.e., the experience that one’s feelings, impulses, actions or thoughts are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcast to others).

Negative symptoms such as affective flattening, alogia or paucity of speech, avolition, asociality and anhedonia.

Grossly disorganized behaviour that impedes goal-directed activity (e.g., behaviour that appears bizarre or purposeless, unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses that interferes with the ability to organize behaviour.)

Psychomotor disturbances such as catatonic restlessness or agitation, posturing, waxy flexibility, negativism, mutism, or stupor. Note: If the full syndrome of Catatonia is present in the context of Schizophrenia, the diagnosis of Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder should also be assigned.

The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour) and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g., corticosteroids) on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g., from alcohol)."
Schizoaffective disorder,"Schizoaffective disorder is an episodic disorder in which the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia and a manic, mixed, or moderate or severe depressive episode are met within the same episode of illness, either simultaneously or within a few days of each other. Prominent symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganisation in the form of thought, experiences of influence, passivity and control) are accompanied by typical symptoms of a moderate or severe depressive episode (e.g. depressed mood, loss of interest, reduced energy), a manic episode (e.g. an extreme mood state characterised by euphoria, irritability, or expansiveness; increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy) or a mixed episode. Psychomotor disturbances, including catatonia, may be present. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one month. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumor) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g. alcohol withdrawal).","All diagnostic requirements for Schizophrenia are met concurrently with mood symptoms that meet the diagnostic requirements of a Moderate or Severe Depressive Episode, a Manic Episode, or a Mixed Episode. Note: In making a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Episodes must include depressed mood, not just diminished interest or pleasure.
The onset of the psychotic and mood symptoms is either simultaneous or occurs within a few days of one another.
The duration of symptomatic episodes is at least 1 month for both psychotic and mood symptoms.
The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour) and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g., from alcohol)."
Schizotypal disorder,"Schizotypal disorder is characterised by an enduring pattern (i.e. characteristic of the person’s functioning over a period of at least several years) of eccentricities in behaviour, appearance and speech, accompanied by cognitive and perceptual distortions, unusual beliefs, and discomfort with— and often reduced capacity for— interpersonal relationships. Symptoms may include constricted or inappropriate affect and anhedonia. Paranoid ideas, ideas of reference, or other psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations in any modality, may occur, but are not of sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder. The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","An enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions, beliefs and behaviours that are not of sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Delusional Disorder. The pattern includes several of the following symptoms:
Constricted affect, such that the individual appears cold and aloof;
Behaviour or appearance that is odd, eccentric, unusual, or peculiar and is inconsistent with cultural or subcultural norms;
Poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal;
Unusual beliefs or magical thinking influencing the person’s behaviour in ways that are inconsistent with subcultural norms, but not reaching the diagnostic requirements for a delusion;
Unusual perceptual distortions such as intense illusions, depersonalization, derealization, or auditory or other hallucinations;
Suspiciousness or paranoid ideas;
Vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate, or stereotyped thinking, manifest in odd speech without gross incoherence;
Obsessive ruminations without a sense that the obsession is foreign or unwanted, often with body dysmorphic, sexual, or aggressive content.
The individual has never met the diagnostic requirements for Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Delusional Disorder. That is, transient delusions, hallucinations, formal thought disorder, or experiences of influence, passivity or control may occur, but do not last for more than 1 month.
Symptoms should have been present, continuously or episodically, for at least 2 years.
The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour), are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g., from alcohol), and are not better accounted for by another Mental, Behavioural, or Neurodevelopmental Disorder."
Acute and transient psychotic disorder,"Acute and transient psychotic disorder is characterised by acute onset of psychotic symptoms that emerge without a prodrome and reach their maximal severity within two weeks. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganisation of thought processes, perplexity or confusion, and disturbances of affect and mood. Catatonia-like psychomotor disturbances may be present. Symptoms typically change rapidly, both in nature and intensity, from day to day, or even within a single day. The duration of the episode does not exceed 3 months, and most commonly lasts from a few days to 1 month. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g. alcohol withdrawal).","Acute onset of psychotic symptoms, which can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, or experiences of influence, passivity or control, that emerge without a prodrome, progressing from a non-psychotic state to a clearly psychotic state within 2 weeks. Psychomotor disturbances may also be present, including catatonia.
Symptoms change rapidly, both in nature and intensity. Such changes may occur from day to day, or even within a single day.
Absence of negative symptoms (i.e., affective flattening, alogia or paucity of speech, avolition, asociality, anhedonia) during the psychotic episode.
The duration of the symptoms does not exceed 3 months, and most commonly lasts from a few days to 1 month.
The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour), are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g., from alcohol), and are not better accounted for by Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder."
Delusional disorder,"Delusional disorder is characterised by the development of a delusion or set of related delusions, typically persisting for at least 3 months and often much longer, in the absence of a Depressive, Manic, or Mixed mood episode. The delusions are variable in content across individuals, but typically stable within individuals, although they may evolve over time. Other characteristic symptoms of Schizophrenia (i.e. clear and persistent hallucinations, negative symptoms, disorganised thinking, or experiences of influence, passivity, or control) are not present, although various forms of perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations, illusions, misidentifications of persons) thematically related to the delusion are still consistent with the diagnosis. Apart from actions and attitudes directly related to the delusion or delusional system, affect, speech, and behavior are typically unaffected. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol withdrawal).","Presence of a delusion or set of related delusions, typically persisting for at least 3 months and often much longer, in the absence of a Depressive, Manic or Mixed Episode.
The delusions are variable in content across individuals, while showing remarkable stability within individuals, although they may evolve over time. Common forms of delusions include persecutory, somatic (e.g., a belief that organs are rotting or malfunctioning despite normal medical examination), grandiose (e.g., a belief that one has discovered an elixir that gives eternal life), jealous (e.g., the unjustified belief that one’s spouse is unfaithful) and erotomania (i.e., the belief that another person, usually a famous or high-status stranger, is in love with the person experiencing the delusion).
Absence of clear and persistent hallucinations, severely disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder), experiences of influence, passivity, or control or negative symptoms characteristic of Schizophrenia. However, in some cases, specific hallucinations typically related to the content of the delusions may be present (e.g., tactile hallucinations in delusions of being infected by parasites or insects).
Apart from the actions and attitudes directly related to the delusional system, affect, speech, and behaviour are typically unaffected.
The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour), are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g., from alcohol), and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., another Primary Psychotic Disorder, a Mood Disorder, an Obsessive-Compulsive or Related Disorder, an Eating Disorder)."
Secondary psychotic syndrome,"A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent hallucinations or delusions judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., an acute stress reaction in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the psychotic symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.","The presence of prominent hallucinations and/or delusions.
The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. This judgment depends on establishing that:
The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms;
The course of the hallucinations and/or delusions (e.g., onset, remission, response of the psychotic symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition; and
The symptoms are not better accounted for by Delirium, Dementia, another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, a Mood Disorder) or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects.
The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention."
Catatonia,"Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances, characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abormal psychomotor activity. The assessment of catatonia is complex and requires observation, interview and physical exam. Catatonia can occur in the context of another mental disorder, such as Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorders, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, especially Autism Spectrum Disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal from certain psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of certain psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Finally, Catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Examples of medical conditions that may be associated with Catatonia include diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, and encephalitis.","Decreased Psychomotor Activity

Staring: fixed gaze, decreased blinking, often with widely opened eyes.
Ambitendency: appearance of being ‘motorically stuck’ in indecisive or hesitant movement.
Negativism: opposing or behaving contrary to requests or instructions, which may lead to withdrawal from interaction with others (turning away) or refusal to take food or drink when offered.
Stupor: immobility; no or markedly reduced psychomotor activity; minimally responsive to external stimuli.
Mutism: no or very little verbal response; speech may be hushed or whispered to the point of being unintelligible. (Note: Do not count if speech symptoms are due to a Disease of the Nervous System, Developmental Speech or Language Disorder, or other disease or disorder affecting speech.)
Increased psychomotor activity

Any of the following: extreme hyperactivity or agitation for no reason with nonpurposeful movements and/or uncontrollable, extreme emotional reactions; impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour without provocation); combativeness (striking out against others usually in an undirected manner, with or without the potential for injury). (Note: Multiple manisfestations of increased psychomotor activity should only be counted as one of the required three symptoms in order to meet the requirements for Catatonia.)
Abnormal psychomotor activity

Grimacing: odd or distorted facial expressions; often inappropriate and irrelevant to the situation.
Mannerisms: odd, purposeful movements that are not appropriate to the individual’s cultural context; exaggerated caricatures of mundane movements.
Posturing: spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity; sitting or standing for long periods without reacting.
Stereotypy: repetitive, non-goal-directed motor activity (e.g., finger-play, repeatedly touching, patting or rubbing self); the abnormality is not inherent in the action but relates to its frequency
Rigidity: resistance by way of increased muscle tone. May range in severity from mildly increased tone to severe ‘lead pipe’ rigidity. (Requires examination.)
Echophenomena: mimicking examiner’s speech (echolalia) or movements (echopraxia).
Verbigeration: continuous and directionless repetition of words, phrases, or sentences.
Waxy flexibility: slight and even resistance to positioning by examiner. (Requires examination.)
Catalepsy: passive induction of a posture (typically examiner passively moves patient’s extremity) which remains held against gravity. (Requires examination.)
The symptoms typically last for at least several hours but can persist much longer. For some severe items (e.g., stupor, catalepsy, mutism, negativism) or if vital sign (autonomic) abnormality is present, a short duration (e.g., 15 minutes) may be sufficient to be considered as a qualifying symptom.

The symptoms result in significant impairment in daily functioning or are severe enough to cause serious medical complications (e.g., contractures, exhaustion, dehydration, aspiration) or risk of death resulting from autonomic abnormalities or complications (e.g., rigidity leading to renal failure from rhabdomyolysis)."
Bipolar or related disorders,"Bipolar and related disorders are episodic mood disorders defined by the occurrence of Manic, Mixed or Hypomanic episodes or symptoms. These episodes typically alternate over the course of these disorders with Depressive episodes or periods of depressive symptoms.","The presentation is characterized by manic or hypomanic symptoms (with or without depressive symptoms) that share primary clinical features with other Bipolar or Related Disorders (e.g., persistent elevation of mood).
The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the Bipolar or Related Disorders grouping.
The symptoms are not better accounted for by another Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorder (e.g., Schizoaffective Disorder; a Disorder Due to Addictive Behaviours; a Personality Disorder).

The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Depressive disorders,"Depressive disorders are characterised by depressive mood (e.g., sad, irritable, empty) or loss of pleasure accompanied by other cognitive, behavioural, or neurovegetative symptoms that significantly affect the individual’s ability to function. A depressive disorder should not be diagnosed in individuals who have ever experienced a manic, mixed or hypomanic episode, which would indicate the presence of a bipolar disorder.","The presentation is characterized by mood symptoms that share primary clinical features with other Depressive Disorders (e.g., depressed mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, decreased energy levels, disruptions in sleep or eating).
The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the Depressive Disorders grouping.
The symptoms are not better accounted for by another Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, an Anxiety or Fear-Related Disorder, a Disorder Specifically Associated with Stress).
The symptoms and behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepine) on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g., from cocaine).

Secondary mood syndrome,"A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent mood symptoms (i.e., depression, elevated mood, irritability) judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., depressive symptoms in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.","The presence of prominent depressive, manic, or mixed mood symptoms.
The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. This judgment depends on establishing that:
The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms;
The course of the mood symptoms (e.g., onset, remission, response of the mood symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition; and
The symptoms are not better accounted for by Delirium, Dementia, another mental disorder (e.g., Depressive Disorder, Bipolar I Disorder, Bipolar II Disorder, Cyclothymic Disorder, or Catatonia) or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects.

Anxiety and general apprehensiveness or worry are accompanied by additional characteristic symptoms, such as:
Muscle tension or motor restlessness.
Sympathetic autonomic overactivity as evidenced by frequent gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and/or abdominal distress, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shaking, and/or dry mouth.
Subjective experience of nervousness, restlessness, or being ‘on edge’.

Panic disorder,"Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks that are not restricted to particular stimuli or situations. Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension accompanied by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms (e.g. palpitations or increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, chills, hot flushes, fear of imminent death). In addition, panic disorder is characterised by persistent concern about the recurrence or significance of panic attacks, or behaviours intended to avoid their recurrence, that results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system.","Recurrent panic attacks, which are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension characterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms.

At least some of the panic attacks are unexpected, that is they are not restricted to particular stimuli or situations but rather seem to arise ‘out of the blue’.
Panic attacks are followed by persistent concern or worry (e.g., for several weeks) about their recurrence or their perceived negative significance (e.g., that the physiological symptoms may be those of a myocardial infarction), or behaviours intended to avoid their recurrence (e.g., only leaving the home with a trusted companion).
Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety-provoking situations in the context of another mental disorder.

Agoraphobia,"Agoraphobia is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in response to multiple situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available, such as using public transportation, being in crowds, being outside the home alone (e.g., in shops, theatres, standing in line). The individual is consistently anxious about these situations due to a fear of specific negative outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, other incapacitating or embarrassing physical symptoms). The situations are actively avoided, entered only under specific circumstances such as in the presence of a trusted companion, or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The symptoms persist for least several months, and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.","Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in, or in anticipation of, multiple situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available, such as using public transportation, being in crowds, being outside the home alone, in shops, theatres, or standing in line.

The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Separation anxiety disorder,"Separation anxiety disorder is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from specific attachment figures. In children and adolescents, separation anxiety typically focuses on caregivers, parents or other family members and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentally normative. In adults, the focus is typically a romantic partner or children. Manifestations of separation anxiety may include thoughts of harm or untoward events befalling the attachment figure, reluctance to go to school or work, recurrent excessive distress upon separation, reluctance or refusal to sleep away from the attachment figure, and recurrent nightmares about separation. The symptoms persist for at least several months and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.","Marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person is attached (i.e., with whom the individual has a deep emotional bond). In children and adolescents, key attachment figures that are most commonly the focus of separation anxiety include parents, caregivers, and other family members, and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentally normative. In adults, separation anxiety most often involves a spouse, romantic partner, or children. Manifestations of fear or anxiety related to separation depend on the individual’s developmental level, but may include:
Persistent thoughts that harm or some other untoward event (e.g., being kidnapped) will lead to separation.
Reluctance or refusal to go to school or work.
Recurrent excessive distress (e.g., tantrums, social withdrawal) related to being separated from the attachment figure.
Reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near the attachment figure.
Recurrent nightmares about separation.
Physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, stomachache, headache, on occasions that involve separation from the attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to school or work.

Selective mutism,"Selective mutism is characterised by consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child demonstrates adequate language competence in specific social situations, typically at home, but consistently fails to speak in others, typically at school. The disturbance lasts for at least one month, is not limited to the first month of school, and is of sufficient severity to interfere with educational achievement or with social communication. Failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation (e.g. a different language spoken at school than at home).","Consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child demonstrates adequate language competence in specific social situations, typically at home, but consistently fails to speak in others, typically at school.
The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month, not limited to the first month of school.

Selectivity of speech is sufficiently severe so as to interfere with educational achievement or with social communication or is associated with significant impairment in other important areas of functioning."
Hypochondriasis,"Hypochondriasis is characterised by persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility of having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses. The preoccupation is accompanied by either: 1) repetitive and excessive health-related behaviours, such as repeatedly checking of the body for evidence of illness, spending inordinate amounts of time searching for information about the feared illness, repeatedly seeking reassurance (e.g. arranging multiple medical consultations); or 2) maladaptive avoidance behaviour related to health (e.g. avoids medical appointments).

Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is characterised by the presence of persistent obsessions or compulsions, or most commonly both. Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts, images, or impulses/urges that are intrusive, unwanted, and are commonly associated with anxiety. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them by performing compulsions. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours including repetitive mental acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, or to achieve a sense of ‘completeness’. In order for obsessive-compulsive disorder to be diagnosed, obsessions and compulsions must be time consuming (e.g. taking more than an hour per day) or result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Presence of persistent obsessions and/or compulsions.
Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images (e.g., of violent scenes), or impulses/urges (e.g., to stab someone) that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted, and are commonly associated with anxiety. The individual typically attempts to ignore or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them by performing compulsions.
Compulsions are repetitive behaviours or rituals, including repetitive mental acts, that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, or to achieve a sense of ‘completeness’. Examples of overt behaviours include repetitive washing, checking, and ordering of objects. Examples of analogous mental acts include mentally repeating specific phrases in order to prevent negative outcomes, reviewing a memory to make sure that one has caused no harm, and mentally counting objects. Compulsions are either not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g., arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (e.g., showering daily for hours to prevent illness).
Obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per day) or result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., basal ganglia ischemic stroke) and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., amphetamine), including withdrawal effects."
Body dysmorphic disorder,"Body Dysmorphic Disorder is characterised by persistent preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in appearance that are either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. Individuals experience excessive self-consciousness, often with ideas of reference (i.e., the conviction that people are taking notice, judging, or talking about the perceived defect or flaw). In response to their preoccupation, individuals engage in repetitive and excessive behaviours that include repeated examination of the appearance or severity of the perceived defect or flaw, excessive attempts to camouflage or alter the perceived defect, or marked avoidance of social situations or triggers that increase distress about the perceived defect or flaw. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Persistent preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in appearance, or ugliness in general, that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others.

The preoccupation or self-consciousness is accompanied by any of the following:
Repetitive and excessive behaviours, such as repeated examination of the appearance or severity of the perceived defect(s) or flaw(s) (e.g., by checking in reflective surfaces) or comparison of the relevant feature with that of others;
Excessive attempts to camouflage or alter the perceived defect (e.g., specific and elaborate forms of dress, undergoing ill-advised cosmetic surgical procedures);
Marked avoidance of social or other situations or stimuli that increase distress about the perceived defect(s) or flaw(s) (e.g., reflective surfaces, changing rooms, swimming pools).
The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects.

Olfactory reference disorder,"Olfactory Reference Disorder is characterised by persistent preoccupation with the belief that one is emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odour or breath that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. Individuals experience excessive self-consciousness about the perceived odour, often with ideas of reference (i.e., the conviction that people are taking notice, judging, or talking about the odour). In response to their preoccupation, individuals engage in repetitive and excessive behaviours such as repeatedly checking for body odour or checking the perceived source of the smell, or repeatedly seeking reassurance, excessive attempts to camouflage, alter, or prevent the perceived odour, or marked avoidance of social situations or triggers that increase distress about the perceived foul or offensive odour.

The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Hoarding disorder,"Hoarding disorder is characterised by accumulation of possessions that results in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that their use or safety is compromised. Accumulation occurs due to both repetitive urges or behaviours related to amassing items and difficulty discarding possessions due to a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them. If living areas are uncluttered this is only due to the intervention of third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities). Amassment may be passive (e.g. accumulation of incoming flyers or mail) or active (e.g. excessive acquisition of free, purchased, or stolen items). The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Accumulation of possessions that results in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that their use or safety is compromised.

Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders,"Body focused repetitive behaviour disorders are characterised by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair-pulling, skin-picking, lip-biting), typically accompanied by unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour involved, and which lead to dermatological sequelae (e.g., hair loss, skin lesions, lip abrasions). The behaviour may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Recurrent habitual actions directed at the integument other than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g., lip biting or nail biting),
Unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease the behaviour.
Significant lesions or other impact on appearance resulting from the behaviour.

The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention."
Tourette syndrome,"Tourette syndrome is a chronic tic disorder characterised by the presence of both chronic motor tics and vocal (phonic) tics, with onset during the developmental period. Motor and vocal tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic, and recurrent movements or vocalizations, respectively. In order to be diagnosed as Tourette syndrome, both motor and vocal tics must have been present for at least one year, although they may not manifest concurrently or consistently throughout the symptomatic course.","The presence of both motor tic(s) and phonic tic(s) that may or may not manifest concurrently or continuously during the symptomatic course.

The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., Huntington Disease) and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., amphetamine), including withdrawal effects (e.g., from benzodiazepines)."
Post traumatic stress disorder,"Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for example as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Exposure to an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening or horrific nature. Such events include, but are not limited to, directly experiencing natural or human-made disasters, combat, serious accidents, torture, sexual violence, terrorism, assault or acute life-threatening illness (e.g., a heart attack); witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected, or violent manner; and learning about the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one.
Following the traumatic event or situation, the development of a characteristic syndrome lasting for at least several weeks, consisting of all three core elements:
Re-experiencing the traumatic event in the present, in which the event(s) is not just remembered but is experienced as occurring again in the here and now. This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings), or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event(s). Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations. Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed or immersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumatic event, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to reminders of the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event(s) and remembering the feelings that one experienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement.
Deliberate avoidance of reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s). This may take the form either of active internal avoidance of thoughts and memories related to the event(s), or external avoidance of people, conversations, activities, or situations reminiscent of the event(s). In extreme cases the person may change their environment (e.g., move to a different city or change jobs) to avoid reminders.
Persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for example as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. Hypervigilant persons constantly guard themselves against danger and feel themselves or others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g., not sitting with ones’ back to the door, repeated checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirrors).
The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Complex post traumatic stress disorder,"Complex post traumatic stress disorder (Complex PTSD) is a disorder that may develop following exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g. torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse). All diagnostic requirements for PTSD are met. In addition, Complex PTSD is characterised by severe and persistent 1) problems in affect regulation; 2) beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the traumatic event; and 3) difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. These symptoms cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible. Such events include, but are not limited to, torture, concentration camps, slavery, genocide campaigns and other forms of organized violence, prolonged domestic violence, and repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse.
Following the traumatic event, the development of all three core elements of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, lasting for at least several weeks:
Re-experiencing the traumatic event after the traumatic event has occurred, in which the event(s) is not just remembered but is experienced as occurring again in the here and now. This typically occurs in the form of vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings), or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are thematically related to the traumatic event(s). Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations. Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed or immersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumatic event, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to reminders of the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event(s) and remembering the feelings that one experienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement.
Deliberate avoidance of reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s). This may take the form either of active internal avoidance of thoughts and memories related to the event(s), or external avoidance of people, conversations, activities, or situations reminiscent of the event(s). In extreme cases the person may change their environment (e.g., move house or change jobs) to avoid reminders.
Persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for example as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. Hypervigilant persons constantly guard themselves against danger and feel themselves or others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (not sitting with ones’ back to the door, repeated checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirror). In Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, unlike in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the startle reaction may in some cases be diminished rather than enhanced.
Severe and pervasive problems in affect regulation. Examples include heightened emotional reactivity to minor stressors, violent outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behaviour, dissociative symptoms when under stress, and emotional numbing, particularly the inability to experience pleasure or positive emotions.
Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by deep and pervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the stressor. For example, the individual may feel guilty about not having escaped from or succumbing to the adverse circumstance, or not having been able to prevent the suffering of others.
Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. The person may consistently avoid, deride or have little interest in relationships and social engagement more generally. Alternatively, there may be occasional intense relationships, but the person has difficulty sustaining them.
The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Prolonged grief disorder,"Prolonged grief disorder is a disturbance in which, following the death of a partner, parent, child, or other person close to the bereaved, there is persistent and pervasive grief response characterised by longing for the deceased or persistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness, guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self, an inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social or other activities). The grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following the loss (more than 6 months at a minimum) and clearly exceeds expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s culture and context. Grief reactions that have persisted for longer periods that are within a normative period of grieving given the person’s cultural and religious context are viewed as normal bereavement responses and are not assigned a diagnosis. The disturbance causes significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","History of bereavement following the death of a partner, parent, child, or other person close to the bereaved.
A persistent and pervasive grief response characterized by longing for the deceased or persistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain. This may be manifested by experiences such as sadness, guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self, an inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, and difficulty in engaging with social or other activities.
The pervasive grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following the loss, markedly exceeding expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s culture and context. Grief responses lasting for less than 6 months, and for longer periods in some cultural contexts, should not be regarded as meeting this requirement.
The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort."
Adjustment disorder,"Adjustment disorder is a maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors (e.g. divorce, illness or disability, socio-economic problems, conflicts at home or work) that usually emerges within a month of the stressor. The disorder is characterised by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences, including excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant rumination about its implications, as well as by failure to adapt to the stressor that causes significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., Mood Disorder, another Disorder Specifically Associated with Stress) and typically resolve within 6 months, unless the stressor persists for a longer duration.","A maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors (e.g., single stressful event, ongoing psychosocial difficulty or a combination of stressful life situations) that usually emerges within a month of the stressor.

Reactive attachment disorder,"Reactive attachment disorder is characterised by grossly abnormal attachment behaviours in early childhood, occurring in the context of a history of grossly inadequate child care (e.g., severe neglect, maltreatment, institutional deprivation). Even when an adequate primary caregiver is newly available, the child does not turn to the primary caregiver for comfort, support and nurture, rarely displays security-seeking behaviours towards any adult, and does not respond when comfort is offered. Reactive attachment disorder can only be diagnosed in children, and features of the disorder develop within the first 5 years of life. However, the disorder cannot be diagnosed before the age of 1 year (or a developmental age of less than 9 months), when the capacity for selective attachments may not be fully developed, or in the context of Autism spectrum disorder.","A history of grossly insufficient care that may include:
Persistent disregard for the child’s basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection.
Persistent disregard for the child’s basic physical needs.
Repeated changes of primary caregivers (e.g., frequent changes in foster care providers).
Rearing in unusual settings (e.g., institutions) that prevent formation of stable selective attachments.
Maltreatment.
Markedly abnormal attachment behaviours towards adult caregivers in a child, characterized by a persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behaviour including both of the following:
Minimal seeking of comfort when distressed.
Rare or minimal response to comfort when it is offered.
The grossly insufficient care is presumed to be responsible for the persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behaviour.
The symptoms are evident before the age of 5.
The child has reached a developmental level by which the capacity to form selective attachments with caregivers normally develops, which typically occurs at a chronological age of 1 year or a developmental age of at least 9 months.
The abnormal attachment behaviours are not better accounted for by Autism Spectrum Disorder.
The abnormal attachment behaviours are not confined to a specific dyadic relationship."
Disinhibited social engagement disorder,"Disinhibited social engagement disorder is characterised by grossly abnormal social behaviour, occurring in the context of a history of grossly inadequate child care (e.g., severe neglect, institutional deprivation). The child approaches adults indiscriminately, lacks reticence to approach, will go away with unfamiliar adults, and exhibits overly familiar behaviour towards strangers. Disinhibited social engagement disorder can only be diagnosed in children, and features of the disorder develop within the first 5 years of life. However, the disorder cannot be diagnosed before the age of 1 year (or a developmental age of less than 9 months), when the capacity for selective attachments may not be fully developed, or in the context of Autism spectrum disorder.","A history of grossly insufficient care of a child that may include:

Dissociative identity disorder,"Dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning in interacting with others or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life such as parenting, or work, or in response to specific situations (e.g., those that are perceived as threatening).

Secondary dissociative syndrome,"A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization, derealization) that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., as part of an acute stress reaction in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the dissociative symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.","The presence of prominent dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, dissociative amnesia, a marked alteration in the individual’s normal sense of personal identity).

Anorexia Nervosa,"Anorexia Nervosa is characterised by significantly low body weight for the individual’s height, age and developmental stage that is not due to another health condition or to the unavailability of food. A commonly used threshold is body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m2 in adults and BMI-for-age under 5th percentile in children and adolescents. Rapid weight loss (e.g. more than 20% of total body weight within 6 months) may replace the low body weight guideline as long as other diagnostic requirements are met. Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to gain weight as expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather than weight loss. Low body weight is accompanied by a persistent pattern of behaviours to prevent restoration of normal weight, which may include behaviours aimed at reducing energy intake (restricted eating), purging behaviours (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives), and behaviours aimed at increasing energy expenditure (e.g. excessive exercise), typically associated with a fear of weight gain. Low body weight or shape is central to the person's self-evaluation or is inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive.","Significantly low body weight for the individual’s height, age, developmental stage, or weight history.

Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to gain weight as expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather than weight loss.
Low body weight is not better accounted for by another medical condition or the unavailability of food.
A persistent pattern of restrictive eating or other behaviours aimed at establishing or maintaining abnormally low body weight, typically associated with extreme fear of weight gain. Behaviours may be aimed at reducing energy intake, by fasting, choosing low calorie food, excessively slow eating of small amounts of food, and hiding or spitting out food, as well as purging behaviours, such as self-induced vomiting and use of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or omission of insulin doses in individuals with diabetes. Behaviours may also be aimed at increasing energy expenditure through excessive exercise, motor hyperactivity, deliberate exposure to cold, and use of medication that increases energy expenditure (e.g., stimulants, weight loss medication, herbal products for reducing weight, thyroid hormones).
Excessive preoccupation with body weight or shape. Low body weight is overvalued and central to the person's self-evaluation, or the person’s body weight or shape is inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive. Preoccupation with weight or shape, when not explicitly reported, may be manifested by behaviours such as repeatedly checking body weight using scales; repeatedly checking one’s body shape using tape measures or reflection in mirrors; constantly monitoring the calorie content of food or searching for information on how to lose weight; or by extreme avoidant behaviours, such as refusal to have mirrors at home, avoidance of tight-fitting clothes, or refusal to know one’s weight or purchase clothing with specified sizing."
Bulimia Nervosa,"Bulimia Nervosa is characterised by frequent, recurrent episodes of binge eating (e.g. once a week or more over a period of at least one month). A binge eating episode is a distinct period of time during which the individual experiences a subjective loss of control over eating, eating notably more or differently than usual, and feels unable to stop eating or limit the type or amount of food eaten. Binge eating is accompanied by repeated inappropriate compensatory behaviours aimed at preventing weight gain (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or enemas, strenuous exercise). The individual is preoccupied with body shape or weight, which strongly influences self-evaluation. There is marked distress about the pattern of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviour or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The individual does not meet the diagnostic requirements of Anorexia Nervosa.","Frequent, recurrent episodes of binge eating (e.g., once a week or more over a period of at least 1 month). Binge eating is defined as a discrete period of time (e.g., 2 hours) during which the individual experiences a loss of control over their eating behaviour and eats notably more or differently than usual. Loss of control over eating may be described by the individual as feeling like they cannot stop or limit the amount or type of food eaten; having difficulty stopping eating once they have started; or giving up even trying to control their eating because they know they will end up overeating.
Repeated inappropriate compensatory behaviours to prevent weight gain (e.g., once a week or more over a period of at least 1 month). The most common compensatory behaviour is self-induced vomiting, which typically occurs within an hour of binge eating. Other inappropriate compensatory behaviours include fasting or using diuretics to induce weight loss, using laxatives or enemas to reduce the absorption of food, omission of insulin doses in individuals with diabetes, and strenuous exercise to greatly increase energy expenditure.

A binge eating episode is a distinct period of time during which the individual experiences a subjective loss of control over eating, eating notably more or differently than usual, and feels unable to stop eating or limit the type or amount of food eaten. Binge eating is experienced as very distressing, and is often accompanied by negative emotions such as guilt or disgust. However, unlike in Bulimia Nervosa, binge eating episodes are not regularly followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviours aimed at preventing weight gain (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or enemas, strenuous exercise).

Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder,"Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterised by avoidance or restriction of food intake that results in: 1) the intake of an insufficient quantity or variety of food to meet adequate energy or nutritional requirements that has resulted in significant weight loss, clinically significant nutritional deficiencies, dependence on oral nutritional supplements or tube feeding, or has otherwise negatively affected the physical health of the individual; or 2) significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g.,due to avoidance or distress related to participating in social experiences involving eating). The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight or shape. Restricted food intake and its effects on weight, other aspects of health, or functioning is not due to unavailability of food, not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. food allergies, hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder, and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system including withdrawal effects.","Avoidance or restriction of food intake that results in either or both of the following:
The intake of an insufficient quantity or variety of food to meet adequate energy or nutritional requirements that has resulted in significant weight loss, clinically significant nutritional deficiencies, dependence on oral nutritional supplements or tube feeding, or has otherwise negatively affected the physical health of the individual.
Significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to avoidance or distress related to participating in social experiences involving eating).
The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight or shape.
Restricted food intake and consequent weight loss (or failure to gain weight), or other impact on physical health or related functional impairment, are not due to unavailability of food; are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., food allergies, hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder; and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication, including withdrawal effects."
Pica,"Pica is characterised by the regular consumption of non-nutritive substances, such as non-food objects and materials (e.g., clay, soil, chalk, plaster, plastic, metal and paper) or raw food ingredients (e.g., large quantities of salt or corn flour) that is persistent or severe enough to require clinical attention in an individual who has reached a developmental age at which they would be expected to distinguish between edible and non-edible substances (approximately 2 years). That is, the behaviour causes damage to health, impairment in functioning, or significant risk due to the frequency, amount or nature of the substances or objects ingested.","Regular consumption of non-nutritive substances, such as non-food objects and materials (e.g., clay, soil, chalk, plaster, plastic, metal and paper), or raw food ingredients (e.g., large quantities of salt or corn flour).
The ingestion of non-nutritive substances is persistent or severe enough to require clinical attention. That is, the behaviour causes damage or significant risk to health or impairment in functioning due to the frequency, amount or nature of the substances or objects ingested.
Based on age and level of intellectual functioning, the individual would be expected to distinguish between edible and non-edible substances. In typical development, this occurs at approximately 2 years of age.
The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., nutritional deficiency)."
Rumination-regurgitation disorder,"Rumination-regurgitation disorder is characterised by the intentional and repeated bringing up of previously swallowed food back to the mouth (i.e., regurgitation), which may be re-chewed and re-swallowed (i.e. rumination), or may be deliberately spat out (but not as in vomiting). The regurgitation behaviour is frequent (at least several times per week) and sustained over a period of at least several weeks. The regurgitation behaviour is not fully accounted for by another medical condition that directly causes regurgitation (e.g., oesophageal strictures or neuromuscular disorders affecting oesophageal functioning) or causes nausea or vomiting (e.g. pyloric stenosis). Rumination-regurgitation disorder should only be diagnosed in individuals who have reached a developmental age of at least 2 years.","The intentional and repeated bringing up of previously swallowed food back to the mouth (i.e., regurgitation), which may be re-chewed and re-swallowed (i.e., rumination), or may be deliberately spat out (but not as in vomiting).
The regurgitation behaviour is frequent (at least several times per week) and sustained over a period of at least several weeks.
The diagnosis should only be assigned to individuals who have reached a developmental age of at least 2 years.
The regurgitation behaviour is not a manifestation of another medical condition that directly causes regurgitation (e.g., esophageal strictures or neuromuscular disorders affecting esophageal functioning) or causes nausea or vomiting (e.g., pyloric stenosis)."
Enuresis,"Enuresis is the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed, which may occur during the day or at night, in an individual who has reached a developmental age when urinary continence is ordinarily expected (5 years). The urinary incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bladder control. In most cases, the behaviour is involuntary but in some cases it appears intentional. Enuresis should not be diagnosed if unintentional voiding of urine is due to a health condition that interferes with continence (e.g., diseases of the nervous system or musculoskeletal disorders) or by congenital or acquired abnormalities of the urinary tract.","Repeated and persistent voiding of urine into bed or clothes (e.g., several times per week over several months), which may occur during the day or at night.
The individual has reached a developmental age when urinary continence is ordinarily expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 5 years).
The symptoms are not better accounted for by the physiological effects of a substance or medication or by another medical condition (e.g., a Disease of the Nervous System, a Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, or congenital or acquired abnormalities of the urinary tract)."
Encopresis,"Encopresis is the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places. Encopresis should be diagnosed if inappropriate passage of faeces occurs repeatedly (e.g., at least once per month over a period of several months) in an individual who has reached the developmental age when faecal continence is ordinarily expected (4 years). The faecal incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bowel control. Encopresis should not be diagnosed if faecal soiling is fully attributable to another health condition (e.g., aganglionic megacolon, spina bifida, dementia), congenital or acquired abnormalities of the bowel, gastrointestinal infection, or excessive use of laxatives.","Repeated and persistent passage of faeces in inappropriate places (e.g., at least once per month over a period of several months).
The individual who has reached the developmental age when faecal continence is ordinarily expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 4 years).
Faecal soiling is not better accounted for by the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., excessive use of laxatives) or another medical condition (e.g., aganglionic megacolon, spina bifida, anal stenosis, chronic diarrhoea, congenital or acquired abnormalities of the bowel, or gastrointestinal infection)."
Bodily distress disorder,"Bodily distress disorder is characterised by the presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing to the individual and excessive attention directed toward the symptoms, which may be manifest by repeated contact with health care providers. If another health condition is causing or contributing to the symptoms, the degree of attention is clearly excessive in relation to its nature and progression. Excessive attention is not alleviated by appropriate clinical examination and investigations and appropriate reassurance. Bodily symptoms are persistent, being present on most days for at least several months. Typically, bodily distress disorder involves multiple bodily symptoms that may vary over time. Occasionally there is a single symptom—usually pain or fatigue—that is associated with the other features of the disorder. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation have at least some impact on the individual’s functioning (e.g. strain in relationships, less effective academic or occupational functioning, abandonment of specific leisure activities).","The presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing to the individual. Typically, this involves multiple bodily symptoms that may vary over time. Occasionally the focus is limited to a single symptom, usually pain or fatigue.
Excessive attention is directed toward the symptoms, which may manifest in:
Persistent preoccupation with the severity of the symptoms or their negative consequences. In individuals who have an established medical condition that may be causing or contributing to the symptoms, the degree of attention related to the symptoms is clearly excessive in relation to the nature and severity of the medical condition.
Repeated contacts with health care providers related to the bodily symptoms that are substantially in excess of what would be considered medically necessary.
Excessive attention to the bodily symptoms persists despite appropriate clinical examination and investigations or appropriate reassurance by health care providers.
Bodily symptoms are persistent; that is, some symptoms are present (though not necessarily the same symptoms) on most days during a period of at least several months (e.g., 3 months or more).
The bodily symptoms and related distress and preoccupation result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
The symptoms or the associated distress and preoccupation are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, a Mood Disorder, or an Anxiety or Fear-Related Disorder)."
Body integrity dysphoria,"Body integrity dysphoria is characterised by an intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. major limb amputee, paraplegic, blind), with onset by early adolescence accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration. The desire to become physically disabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by either the preoccupation with the desire (including time spent pretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with productivity, with leisure activities, or with social functioning (e.g. person is unwilling to have a close relationships because it would make it difficult to pretend) or by attempts to actually become disabled have resulted in the person putting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, by a Disease of the Nervous System or by another medical condition, or by Malingering.","An intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g., a major limb amputation, paraplegia, blindness) accompanied by persistent discomfort or intense negative feelings about one’s current body configuration or functioning.
The desire to be disabled results in harmful consequences, manifested by either or both of the following:
Attempts to actually become disabled through self-injury have resulted in the person putting their health or life in significant jeopardy.
Preoccupation with the desire to be disabled results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., avoidance of close relationships, interference with work productivity).
Onset of the persistent desire to be disabled occurs by early adolescence.
The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, in which, for example, a delusional conviction that the limb belongs to another person may be present, Factitious Disorder) or by Malingering.
The symptoms or behaviours are not better accounted for by Gender Incongruence, by a Disease of the Nervous System, or by another medical condition."
Disorders due to substance use,"Disorders due to substance use include disorders that result from a single occasion or repeated use of substances that have psychoactive properties, including certain medications. Disorders related to fourteen classes or groups of psychoactive substances are included. Typically, initial use of these substances produces pleasant or appealing psychoactive effects that are rewarding and reinforcing with repeated use. With continued use, many of the included substances have the capacity to produce dependence. They also have the potential to cause numerous forms of harm, both to mental and physical health. Disorders due to harmful non-medical use of non-psychoactive substances are also included in this grouping.","Disorders Due to Substance Use include disorders that result from a single occasion or repeated use of substances that have psychoactive properties, including certain medications. Disorders related to fourteen classes or groups of psychoactive substances that have important clinical and public health consequences are included, and categories are also available for other specified substances.

Typically, initial use of these substances produces pleasant or appealing psychoactive effects that are rewarding and reinforcing with repeated use. With continued use, many of the included substances have the capacity to produce dependence. They also have the potential to cause numerous forms of harm, both to mental and physical health. Disorders due to harmful non-medical use of non-psychoactive substances (e.g., laxatives, growth hormone, erythropoietin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are also included in this grouping"
Disorders due to addictive behaviours,"Disorders due to addictive behaviours are recognizable and clinically significant syndromes associated with distress or interference with personal functions that develop as a result of repetitive rewarding behaviours other than the use of dependence-producing substances. Disorders due to addictive behaviours include gambling disorder and gaming disorder, which may involve both online and offline behaviour.","The presentation is characterized by symptoms that share primary clinical features with other Disorders Due to Addictive Behaviours, including a persistent pattern of repetitive behaviour in which the individual exhibits impaired control over the behaviour (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context); increasing priority given to the behaviour to the extent that it takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and continuation or escalation of the behaviour despite negative consequences (e.g., family conflict, poor scholastic performance, negative impact on health). Note: Impaired control over substance use or sexual behaviour is not included in this category.
The pattern of repetitive behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent but is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months).
The symptoms are not better accounted for by another Mental, Behavioural, or Neurodevelopmental Disorder (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, an Obsessive-Compulsive or Related Disorder, a Feeding or Eating Disorder, an Impulse Control Disorder), are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects.
The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
Pyromania,"Pyromania is characterised by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to set fires, resulting in multiple acts of, or attempts at, setting fire to property or other objects, in the absence of an apparent motive (e.g., monetary gain, revenge, sabotage, political statement, attracting attention or recognition). There is an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal prior to instances of fire setting, persistent fascination or preoccupation with fire and related stimuli (e.g., watching fires, building fires, fascination with firefighting equipment), and a sense of pleasure, excitement, relief or gratification during, and immediately after the act of setting the fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath. The behaviour is not better explained by intellectual impairment, another mental and behavioural disorder, or substance intoxication.","A recurrent failure to control strong impulses to set fires, resulting in multiple acts of, or attempts at, setting fire to property or other objects.
Lack of an apparent motive for the acts of, or attempts at, fire setting (e.g., monetary gain, revenge, sabotage, political statement, attracting recognition).
Persistent fascination or preoccupation with fire and related stimuli (e.g., watching fires, building fires, fascination with firefighting equipment).
The individual experiences increased tension or affective arousal prior to instances of, or attempts at, fire setting.
The individual experiences pleasure, excitement, relief or gratification during, and immediately following the act of setting the fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath.
Acts of, or attempts at, fire setting are not better accounted for by a Disorder of Intellectual Development, another mental disorder (e.g., a Manic Episode), or Substance Intoxication."
Kleptomania,"Kleptomania is characterised by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to steal objects in the absence of an apparent motive (e.g., objects are not acquired for personal use or monetary gain). There is an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal before instances of theft and a sense of pleasure, excitement, relief, or gratification during and immediately after the act of stealing. The behaviour is not better explained by intellectual impairment, another mental and behavioural disorder, or substance intoxication.","A recurrent failure to control strong impulses to steal objects.
Lack of an apparent motive for stealing objects (e.g., objects are not acquired for personal use or monetary gain).
The individual experiences increased tension or affective arousal prior to instances of theft or attempted theft.
The individual experiences pleasure, excitement, relief, or gratification during and immediately following the act of stealing.
Acts of theft or attempted theft are not better accounted for by a Disorder of Intellectual Development, another mental disorder (e.g., a Manic Episode), or Substance Intoxication."
Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder,"Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour. Symptoms may include repetitive sexual activities becoming a central focus of the person’s life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; numerous unsuccessful efforts to significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; and continued repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences or deriving little or no satisfaction from it. The pattern of failure to control intense, sexual impulses or urges and resulting repetitive sexual behaviour is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g., 6 months or more), and causes marked distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Distress that is entirely related to moral judgments and disapproval about sexual impulses, urges, or behaviours is not sufficient to meet this requirement.","A persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour, manifested in one or more of the following:
Engaging in repetitive sexual behaviour has become a central focus of the individual’s life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities.
The individual has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour.
The individual continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., marital conflict due to sexual behaviour, financial or legal consequences, negative impact on health).
The person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when the individual derives little or no satisfaction from it.
The pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges and resulting repetitive sexual behaviour is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g., 6 months or more).
The pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges and resulting repetitive sexual behaviour is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Manic Episode) or other medical condition and is not due to the effects of a substance or medication.
The pattern of repetitive sexual behaviour results in marked distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Distress that is entirely related to moral judgments and disapproval about sexual impulses, urges, or behaviours is not sufficient to meet this requirement."
Intermittent explosive disorder,"Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by repeated brief episodes of verbal or physical aggression or destruction of property that represent a failure to control aggressive impulses, with the intensity of the outburst or degree of aggressiveness being grossly out of proportion to the provocation or precipitating psychosocial stressors. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not part of a pattern of chronic anger and irritability (e.g., in oppositional defiant disorder). The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","A pattern of recurrent, brief, explosive episodes involving verbal aggression (e.g., verbally attacking another person, temper outbursts, yelling) or physical aggression in an individual who is at least 6 years of age, when inhibition of angry outbursts is expected to have been attained, or equivalent developmental level. Episodes of physical aggression may result in significant damage or destruction of property or physical assault involving personal injury; however, such outcomes are not required for the diagnosis.
The intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or precipitating event or situation.
The explosive outbursts must occur regularly over an extended period of time (e.g., at least 3 months), so as to represent a persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour. A lower frequency threshold (e.g., several times over the course of a year) may be used for high-intensity outbursts with serious negative consequences such as physically assaulting another person, whereas a higher frequency threshold (e.g., two or more times per week) should be used for episodes characterized by verbal aggression or non-assaultive and non-destructive physical aggression.
The aggressive behaviours are clearly impulsive or reactive in nature, and represent a failure to control aggressive impulse. That is, the aggressive acts are not planned or instrumental in achieving a desired outcome.
The frequency and intensity of explosive episodes is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and developmental level.
The explosive outbursts are not better accounted for by another Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorder (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder with chronic irritability-anger, Conduct-Dissocial Disorder, Delirium).
The explosive outbursts are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., amphetamines), including substance intoxication and withdrawal, or due to a Disease of the Nervous System.
The behaviour pattern results in significant distress for the individual with the disorder or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
Gambling disorder,"Gambling disorder is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gambling behaviour, which may be online (i.e., over the internet) or offline, manifested by:

1. impaired control over gambling (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context);

2. increasing priority given to gambling to the extent that gambling takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and

3. continuation or escalation of gambling despite the occurrence of negative consequences.

The pattern of gambling behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent. The pattern of gambling behaviour results in significant distress or in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The gambling behaviour and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to be assigned, although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are met and symptoms are severe.","A persistent pattern of gambling behaviour, which may be predominantly online (i.e., over the internet or similar electronic networks) or offline, manifested by all of the following:
Impaired control over gambling behaviour (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context);

Continuation or escalation of gambling behaviour despite negative consequences (e.g., marital conflict due to gambling behaviour, repeated and substantial financial losses, negative impact on health).
The pattern of gambling behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent but is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months).
The gambling behaviour is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Manic Episode) and is not due to the effects of a substance or medication.
The pattern of gambling behaviour results in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
Gaming disorder,"Gaming disorder is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour (‘digital gaming’ or ‘video-gaming’), which may be online (i.e., over the internet) or offline, manifested by:

1. impaired control over gaming (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context);

2. increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and

Secondary impulse control syndrome,"A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of Impulse Control Disorders or Disorders Due to Addictive Behaviours (e.g., stealing, fire-setting, aggressive outbursts, compulsive sexual behaviour, excessive gambling) that are judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., as part of an adjustment disorder in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the impulse control symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.","The presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of Impulse Control Disorders or Disorders Due to Addictive Behaviours (e.g., stealing, fire-setting, aggressive outbursts, compulsive sexual behaviour, excessive gambling).
The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition, based on evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. This judgment depends on establishing that:
The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms;
The course of the symptoms (e.g., onset, remission, response to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition; and
The symptoms are not better accounted for by Delirium, Dementia, another mental disorder (e.g., an Impulse Control Disorder or a Disorder Due to Addictive Behaviours), or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects.
The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention."
Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders,"Body focused repetitive behaviour disorders are characterised by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair-pulling, skin-picking, lip-biting), typically accompanied by unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour involved, and which lead to dermatological sequelae (e.g., hair loss, skin lesions, lip abrasions). The behaviour may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","Recurrent habitual actions directed at the integument other than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g., lip biting or nail biting),
Unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease the behaviour.
Significant lesions or other impact on appearance resulting from the behaviour.
The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
Oppositional defiant disorder,"Oppositional defiant disorder is a persistent pattern (e.g., 6 months or more) of markedly defiant, disobedient, provocative or spiteful behaviour that occurs more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level and that is not restricted to interaction with siblings. Oppositional defiant disorder may be manifest in prevailing, persistent angry or irritable mood, often accompanied by severe temper outbursts or in headstrong, argumentative and defiant behaviour. The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning","A pattern of markedly noncompliant, defiant, and disobedient behaviour that is atypical for individuals of comparable age, developmental level, gender, and sociocultural context. The pattern of behaviour may include:
Persistent difficulty getting along with others (e.g., arguing with authority figures, actively defying or refusing to comply with requests, directives, or rules, deliberately annoying others, blaming peers or co-workers for mistakes or misbehaviour).
Provocative, spiteful, or vindictive behaviour (e.g., antagonizing others; using social media to attack or mock others).
Extreme irritability or anger (e.g., being touchy or easily annoyed, losing temper, angry outbursts, being angry and resentful).
The behaviour pattern has persisted for an extended period of time (e.g., 6 months or more).
The oppositional behaviours are not better accounted for by relational problems between the individual and a particular authority figure toward whom the individual is behaving in a defiant manner. Examples may include parents, teachers, or supervisors who act antagonistically or place unreasonable demands on the individual.
The behaviour pattern results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational or other important areas of functioning."
Conduct-dissocial disorder,"Conduct-dissocial disorder is characterised by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws are violated such as aggression towards people or animals; destruction of property; deceitfulness or theft; and serious violations of rules. The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. To be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be enduring over a significant period of time (e.g., 12 months or more). Isolated dissocial or criminal acts are thus not in themselves grounds for the diagnosis.","A repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules, or laws are violated. Typically, there are multiple behaviours involved, including one or more of the following:
Aggression towards people or animals, such as bullying, threatening or intimidating others, instigating physical fights, using weapons that can cause serious physical harm to others (such as a brick, broken bottle, knife or gun), physical cruelty to people, physical cruelty to animals, aggressive forms of stealing (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion), or forcing someone into sexual activity.
Destruction of property, such as deliberate fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage or deliberate destruction of others’ property (e.g., purposely breaking other children’s toys, breaking windows, scratching cars, slashing tires).
Deceitfulness or theft, such as stealing items of value (e.g., shoplifting, forgery), lying to obtain goods or favours or to avoid obligations (e.g., ‘conning’ others), or breaking into someone’s house, building or car.
Serious violations of rules, such as children or adolescents repeatedly staying out all night despite parental prohibitions, repeatedly running away from home, or often skipping school or work without permission.
The pattern of behaviour must be persistent and recurrent, including multiple incidents of the types of behaviours described above over an extended period of time (e.g., at least 1 year). The mere commission of one or more delinquent acts is not sufficient for the diagnosis.
The behaviour pattern results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
Personality disorder,"Personality disorder is characterised by problems in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g., identity, self-worth, accuracy of self-view, self-direction), and/or interpersonal dysfunction (e.g., ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfying relationships, ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships) that have persisted over an extended period of time (e.g., 2 years or more). The disturbance is manifest in patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional expression, and behaviour that are maladaptive (e.g., inflexible or poorly regulated) and is manifest across a range of personal and social situations (i.e., is not limited to specific relationships or social roles). The patterns of behaviour characterizing the disturbance are not developmentally appropriate and cannot be explained primarily by social or cultural factors, including socio-political conflict. The disturbance is associated with substantial distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.","An enduring disturbance characterized by problems in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g., identity, self-worth, accuracy of self-view, self-direction), and/or interpersonal dysfunction (e.g., ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfying relationships, ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships).
The disturbance has persisted over an extended period of time (e.g., lasting 2 years or more).
The disturbance is manifest in patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional expression, and behaviour that are maladaptive (e.g., inflexible or poorly regulated).
The disturbance is manifest across a range of personal and social situations (i.e., is not limited to specific relationships or social roles), though it may be consistently evoked by particular types of circumstances and not others.
The symptoms are not due to the direct effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects, and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, a Disease of the Nervous System, or another medical condition.
The disturbance is associated with substantial distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Personality Disorder should not be diagnosed if the patterns of behaviour characterizing the personality disturbance are developmentally appropriate (e.g., problems related to establishing an independent self-identity during adolescence) or can be explained primarily by social or cultural factors, including socio-political conflict."
Secondary personality change,"A syndrome characterised by a persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern that is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under Mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., social withdrawal, avoidance, or dependence in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the personality symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.","The presence of personality disturbance (e.g., marked apathy, indifference, suspiciousness, paranoid ideation, disinhibition) that represents a change from the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern.
The personality change is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. This judgment depends on establishing that:
The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the observed symptoms;
The course of the personality change (e.g., onset, remission, response of the personality disturbance to treatment of the etiological medical condition is consistent with causation by the medical condition; and
The symptoms are not better accounted for by Delirium, Dementia, another mental disorder (e.g., Personality Disorder, Impulse Control Disorders, Secondary Impulse Control or Addictive Behaviour Syndrome) or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects.

Exhibitionistic disorder,"Exhibitionistic disorder is characterised by a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—that involves exposing one’s genitals to an unsuspecting individual in public places, usually without inviting or intending closer contact. In addition, in order for Exhibitionistic Disorder to be diagnosed, the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. Exhibitionistic Disorder specifically excludes consensual exhibitionistic behaviours that occur with the consent of the person or persons involved as well as socially sanctioned forms of exhibitionism.","A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—that involves exposing one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person in public places, usually without inviting or intending closer contact.
The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. Exhibitionistic Disorder should not be diagnosed among children and should be diagnosed only with utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during adolescence and exhibitionistic acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.
The diagnosis of Exhibitionistic Disorder is generally not adequately supported when the evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists solely of a single or very limited number of instances of exhibitionistic behaviour, as there may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g., intoxication, opportunity). In the absence of the individual’s report of their sexual thoughts, fantasies, or urges indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of exhibitionistic sexual arousal, examples of other forms of evidence that may support the presence of an exhibitionistic arousal pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms of sexual behaviour; or planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in exhibitionistic behaviour."
Voyeuristic disorder,"Voyeuristic disorder is characterised by a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—that involves observing an unsuspecting individual who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity. In addition, in order for Voyeuristic Disorder to be diagnosed, the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. Voyeuristic Disorder specifically excludes consensual voyeuristic behaviours that occur with the consent of the person or persons being observed.","A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—that involves stimuli such as observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity.
The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. Voyeuristic Disorder should not be diagnosed among children and is not typically diagnosed among adolescents. Sexual curiosity is typical during adolescence and observation of others may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.
The act of observing in Voyeuristic Disorder is for the purpose of achieving sexual excitement and does not necessarily involve an attempt to initiate sexual activity with the person being observed. Orgasm by masturbation may occur during the voyeuristic activity or later in response to memories of what the individual has seen. More recently, so-called ‘video voyeurs’ have been described who use video equipment to record individuals in public or private places where there is an expectation of privacy.
The diagnosis of Voyeuristic Disorder is generally not adequately supported when the evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists solely of a single or very limited number of instances of voyeuristic behaviour, as there may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g., intoxication, opportunity).

Some individuals with Pedophilic Disorder are attracted only to males, others only to females, and others to both.
Some individuals act on their pedophilic urges only with family members, while others have victims outside their immediate family or both"
Coercive sexual sadism disorder,"Coercive sexual sadism disorder is characterised by a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours—that involves the infliction of physical or psychological suffering on a non-consenting person.

Factitious disorder imposed on self,"Factitious disorder imposed on self is characterised by feigning, falsifying, or inducing medical, psychological, or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury associated with identified deception. If a pre-existing disorder or disease is present, the individual intentionally aggravates existing symptoms or falsifies or induces additional symptoms. The individual seeks treatment or otherwise presents himself or herself as ill, injured, or impaired based on the feigned, falsified, or self-induced signs, symptoms, or injuries. The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by obvious external rewards or incentives (e.g., obtaining disability payments or evading criminal prosecution). This is in contrast to Malingering, in which obvious external rewards or incentives motivate the behaviour","Feigning, falsifying, or intentionally inducing medical, psychological, or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury associated with identified deception.

Delirium,"Delirium is characterized by a disturbance of attention, orientation, and awareness that develops within a short period of time, typically presenting as significant confusion or global neurocognitive impairment, with transient symptoms that may fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition or etiology. Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, and may include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. A disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, including reduced arousal of acute onset or total sleep loss with reversal of the sleep-wake cycle, may also be present. Delirium may be caused by the direct physiological effects of a medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders, by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication, including withdrawal, or by multiple or unknown etiological factors.","A disturbance of attention, orientation, and awareness developing within a short period of time (e.g., within hours or days), typically presenting as significant confusion or global neurocognitive impairment with transient symptoms that may fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition or etiology.

The symptoms are not better accounted for by a typical syndrome of Substance Intoxication or Substance Withdrawal for a substance or medication that is known to be present, although Delirium can occur as a complication of intoxication or withdrawal states (see Delirium Due to Psychoactive Substances Including Medications, below)."
Mild neurocognitive disorder,"Mild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by mild impairment in one or more cognitive domains relative to that expected given the individual’s age and general premorbid level of cognitive functioning, which represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning. Diagnosis is based on report from the patient, informant, or clinical observation, and is accompanied by objective evidence of impairment by quantified clinical assessment or standardized cognitive testing. Cognitive impairment is not severe enough to significantly interfere with an individual’s ability to perform activities related to personal, family, social, educational, and/or occupational functioning or other important functional areas. Cognitive impairment is not attributable to normal aging and may be static, progressive, or may resolve or improve depending on underlying cause or treatment. Cognitive impairment may be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, use of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the etiology may be undetermined. The impairment is not due to current substance intoxication or withdrawal.","Presence of mild impairment in one more or cognitive domains (e.g., attention, executive function, language, memory, perceptual-motor abilities, social cognition) relative to expectations for age and general premorbid level of neurocognitive functioning.
Impairment represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning.
Neurocognitive impairment is not severe enough to significantly interfere with an individual’s ability to perform activities related to personal, family, social, educational, and/or occupational functioning or other important functional areas.
Evidence of mild neurocognitive impairment is based on:
Information obtained from the individual, informant, or clinical observation; and
Objective evidence of impairment as demonstrated by standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment.
Neurocognitive impairment is not attributable to normal aging.
Neurocognitive impairment may be attributable to an underlying acquired Disease of the Nervous System, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, use of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the etiology may be undetermined.
The symptoms are not better explained by another Neurocognitive Disorder, Substance Intoxication or Substance Withdrawal, or another mental disorder (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or other Neurodevelopmental Disorder, Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, a Mood Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a Dissociative Disorder)."
Amnestic disorder,"Amnestic disorder is characterized by prominent memory impairment relative to expectations for age and general premorbid level of cognitive functioning, which represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning, in the absence of other significant cognitive impairment. It is manifested by a deficit in acquiring, learning, and/or retaining new information, and may include the inability to recall previously learned information, without disturbance of consciousness, altered mental status, or delirium. Recent memory is typically more disturbed than remote memory, and the ability to immediately recall a limited amount of information is usually relatively preserved. The memory impairment is severe enough to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. It is is presumed to be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, to use of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the etiology may be undetermined. The impairment is not due to current substance intoxication or withdrawal.","Prominent memory impairment relative to expectations for age and general level of premorbid neurocognitive functioning, in the absence of other significant neurocognitive impairment.

The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort (e.g., compensatory strategies)."
Dementia,"Dementia is characterized by the presence of marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains relative to that expected given the individual’s age and general premorbid level of cognitive functioning, which represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning. Memory impairment is present in most forms of dementia, but cognitive impairment is not restricted to memory (i.e., there is impairment in other areas such as executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgment, psychomotor speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). Neurobehavioural changes may also be present and, in some forms of dementia, may be the presenting symptom. Cognitive impairment is not attributable to normal aging and is severe enough to significantly interfere with independence in an individual’s performance of activities of daily living. The cognitive impairment is presumed to be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, or to use of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the etiology may be undetermined.

Insomnia disorders,"Insomnia disorders are characterised by the complaint of persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder.",
Parasomnia disorders,"Parasomnias are problematic behavioural or physiological events that occur while falling asleep, during sleep, or upon arousal from sleep. Parasomnias may occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), or during transitions to and from sleep. They encompass abnormal sleep related complex movements, behaviours, emotions, perceptions, dreams, and autonomic nervous system activity.",
Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood,"Gender Incongruence of Adolescence and Adulthood is characterised by a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual´s experienced gender and the assigned sex, which often leads to a desire to ‘transition’, in order to live and be accepted as a person of the experienced gender, through hormonal treatment, surgery or other health care services to make the individual´s body align, as much as desired and to the extent possible, with the experienced gender. The diagnosis cannot be assigned prior the onset of puberty. Gender variant behaviour and preferences alone are not a basis for assigning the diagnosis.",
Gender incongruence of childhood,"Gender incongruence of childhood is characterised by a marked incongruence between an individual’s experienced/expressed gender and the assigned sex in pre-pubertal children. It includes a strong desire to be a different gender than the assigned sex; a strong dislike on the child’s part of his or her sexual anatomy or anticipated secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire for the primary and/or anticipated secondary sex characteristics that match the experienced gender; and make-believe or fantasy play, toys, games, or activities and playmates that are typical of the experienced gender rather than the assigned sex. The incongruence must have persisted for about 2 years. Gender variant behaviour and preferences alone are not a basis for assigning the diagnosis.",
