René Cardillac,Mademoiselle de Scuderi,1819,m,"René Cardillac is the main character in E.T.A. Hoffmann's novel ""Mademoiselle de Scuderi."" He is described as the ""most skilled goldsmith in Paris,"" and is also the elusive jewelry thief and murderer that the Parisian police believe to be part of a criminal gang.

Physically, Cardillac is described as being ""rather small than tall, but broad-shouldered and with a strong, muscular build."" Despite being in his late fifties, he remains agile and powerful, emphasized by his ""thick, frizzy, reddish hair"" that adds to his imposing presence. His appearance generally paints him as an honorable and selfless man, always ready to help others, but his ""peculiar gaze from small, deep-set, green-gleaming eyes"" sets him apart and could raise suspicion of hidden malice.

Socially, Cardillac is known as one of the ""strangest people of his time"" because he takes on commissions for significantly lower pay than he deserves. Once he completes the jewelry, however, he becomes unwilling to part with it. He has a selected group of clients from whom he refuses to accept orders, and among them is the Marquise de Maintenon. Unbeknownst to others, Cardillac does this to protect their lives. The details of his history and motives are revealed only after his death, in the report given to Mademoiselle de Scuderi by his apprentice, Olivier Brußon.

Cardillac's key actions in the story involve a pattern of committing murders after reluctantly parting with a piece of jewelry. Whenever he relinquishes a piece, he is haunted by his ""evil star"" and compelled not only to retrieve the jewelry but also to kill its owner. He employs a secret entrance and exit in his house to escape pursuit, notably eluding Desgrais, who relentlessly pursues him during his thieving and killing sprees.

When Cardillac discovers a relationship developing between his daughter Madelon and Olivier Brußon, he throws the young man out of his house. However, when Brußon becomes a witness to one of his murders, Cardillac rehires him and promises him Madelon's hand in marriage, thereby silencing him.

Cardillac's descent into madness is traced back to an eerie incident during his mother's pregnancy involving a ""cavalier in Spanish clothing with a sparkling jewel chain,"" which supposedly impacted him even before birth. As a child, he was obsessively drawn to jewelry, especially precious stones, leading him to pursue the career of a goldsmith. Eventually, he started hearing voices commanding him to commit the murders, haunting him throughout his life.

Later in the story, Cardillac becomes anxious that the ""murderous specter"" might target Mademoiselle de Scuderi after he sends her an exquisite piece of jewelry as a sign of respect and gratitude. To protect her, Brußon follows Cardillac at night to safeguard the elderly lady. However, Cardillac attacks the Count of Miossens, who is prepared for the assault, and is fatally wounded in self-defense. Before dying, Cardillac brings the hands of the betrothed couple, Brußon and Madelon, together with a soulful gaze and a fervent grip.

Throughout the novel, René Cardillac is portrayed as a complex character with conflicting traits. He is both a highly skilled artisan and a ruthless killer, torn between his passion for crafting jewelry and the dark compulsion to take lives, driven by an inexplicable force tied to his mysterious past.",rené cardillac main character eta hoffmann novel mademoiselle de scuderi described most skilled goldsmith paris also elusive jewelry thief murderer parisian police believe part criminal gang physically cardillac described rather small tall broadshouldered strong muscular build despite late fifty remains agile powerful emphasized thick frizzy reddish hair add imposing presence appearance generally paint honorable selfless man always ready help others peculiar gaze small deepset greengleaming eye set apart could raise suspicion hidden malice socially cardillac known one strangest people time take commission significantly lower pay deserves completes jewelry however becomes unwilling part it selected group client refuse accept order among marquise de maintenon unbeknownst others cardillac protect life detail history motif revealed death report given mademoiselle de scuderi apprentice olivier brußon cardillacs key action story involve pattern committing murder reluctantly parting piece jewelry whenever relinquishes piece haunted evil star compelled retrieve jewelry also kill owner employ secret entrance exit house escape pursuit notably eluding desgrais relentlessly pursues thieving killing spree cardillac discovers relationship developing daughter madelon olivier brußon throw young man house however brußon becomes witness one murder cardillac rehires promise madelons hand marriage thereby silencing him cardillacs descent madness traced back eerie incident mother pregnancy involving cavalier spanish clothing sparkling jewel chain supposedly impacted even birth child obsessively drawn jewelry especially precious stone leading pursue career goldsmith eventually started hearing voice commanding commit murder haunting throughout life later story cardillac becomes anxious murderous specter might target mademoiselle de scuderi sends exquisite piece jewelry sign respect gratitude protect her brußon follows cardillac night safeguard elderly lady however cardillac attack count miossens prepared assault fatally wounded selfdefense dying cardillac brings hand betrothed couple brußon madelon together soulful gaze fervent grip throughout novel rené cardillac portrayed complex character conflicting trait highly skilled artisan ruthless killer torn passion crafting jewelry dark compulsion take life driven inexplicable force tied mysterious past,"[-0.13086852 -0.92979115 -0.45881507 ...  0.09048813  1.31978226

Behavioral: Desgrais is shown to be persistent and dedicated to his work. He is driven to solve criminal cases and bring perpetrators to justice.

President La Regnie,Mademoiselle de Scuderi,1819,m,"President La Regnie is a significant character in E.T.A. Hoffmann's novel ""Mademoiselle de Scuderi."" Let's delve into different aspects of his character:

Physical: The novel does not provide a detailed physical description of President La Regnie. However, his demeanor and actions suggest that he might have a stern and severe appearance, befitting a high-ranking judicial official.

Mental: President La Regnie is portrayed as a zealous and relentless investigator, particularly in his role as the head of the Chambre ardente. He is determined to solve the series of poisonings that have plagued Paris, but despite his efforts, he fails to make much progress, leaving the major breakthroughs to Lieutenant Desgrais of the Marechaussee.

Behavioral: La Regnie's behavior is characterized by a blind and fanatical zeal in carrying out his duties as the president of the Chambre ardente. His methods are ruthless and cruel, leading to the comparison of the court to the Inquisition. He resorts to violence and cruelty, leading to the execution of both guilty and innocent individuals, often leaving their fates to chance.

Social: President La Regnie holds a position of authority as the head of the Chambre ardente, a special court established to investigate and prosecute cases related to poisonings and murders.

Head of the Chambre ardente: La Regnie is in charge of the special court set up to investigate the series of poisonings that have taken place in Paris. However, despite his fervent efforts, he is largely unsuccessful in solving the crimes, and most of the progress is made by Lieutenant Desgrais.

Use of Violent Methods: In his pursuit of justice, La Regnie resorts to violent and aggressive methods during interrogations and trials, leading to the execution of numerous suspects, some of whom may be innocent.

Treatment of Mademoiselle de Scuderi: While La Regnie treats Mademoiselle de Scuderi with the respect due to someone favored by the king, he exhibits a mocking and almost sneering attitude towards her efforts to help Brußon, reflecting his distrust of her virtue and intentions.

Intimidation of Witnesses: Even powerful individuals like Graf de Miossens, who killed Cardillac in self-defense, are afraid to speak openly about the incident due to fear of La Regnie's wrath and relentless pursuit of justice.

President La Regnie's character serves as a representation of the dangers of excessive and unchecked power in the pursuit of justice, leading to grave injustices and fear among the populace.

This comment provokes the king's jealousy, leading him to abruptly end the audience. Later, the marquise remains evasive and hesitant to help Mademoiselle de Scuderi further, fearing that the matter might lead the king into territory she doesn't understand, alluding to her own insecurities about retaining the king's affections.

Clara,The Sandman,1816,w,"Clara is a significant character in E.T.A. Hoffmann's novel ""The Sandman."" Here are the different aspects of her character:

Physical: Clara is not considered conventionally beautiful by those who judge beauty based on conventional standards. However, architects praise the ""pure proportions of her figure."" Her appearance is not her defining feature, but her inner qualities stand out more.

Mental: Clara possesses a vibrant imagination, a deep and tender feminine heart, and a sharp intellect. She has a clear and perceptive mind, but she does not resonate with the supernatural and mysterious elements that intrigue her fiancé, Nathanael.

Behavioral: Clara is patient and understanding with Nathanael, even though she does not share his fascination with dark and mystical ideas. She tries to explain to him with psychological insight that his fears and obsessions are products of his own mind.

Social: Clara is engaged to Nathanael and is also the sister of Lothar. After being orphaned as children, Clara and Lothar were taken in by Nathanael's widowed mother. She is well-liked by those who appreciate her cheerful and lighthearted nature. However, her lack of interest in the supernatural leads some, including Nathanael, to consider her cold and prosaic.

Key Actions:

Tragic ending: On a visit to the Rat Tower, Nathanael, in a state of confusion, attempts to push Clara off the tower. Lothar saves her, but Nathanael ends up falling to his death.

Finding happiness: Despite the tragedy, Clara eventually finds happiness in life. She marries someone else, has two cheerful sons, and enjoys domestic contentment that suits her lively and joyous spirit.

Clara's character serves as a contrasting element to Nathanael's dark and tormented psyche.

Coppelius,The Sandman,1816,m,"Advocate Coppelius is a central and mysterious character in E.T.A. Hoffmann's novel ""The Sandman."" Here are the different aspects of his character:

Physical: According to Nathanael's childhood memories, Advocate Coppelius was a tall, broad-shouldered man with an oddly thick head, earth-yellow complexion, and bushy gray eyebrows. He had a crooked mouth that often twisted into a mocking smile. His appearance was considered repulsive and abhorrent by Nathanael and his sisters. The most unsettling aspect of his physical appearance for the children was his hairy fists, which seemed to be associated with bringing misfortune and ruining everything they touched.

Mental: Coppelius is depicted as a sinister and malevolent figure in Nathanael's mind. As a child, Nathanael believed that Coppelius was the embodiment of the Sandman, a nightmarish figure associated with misery, suffering, and eternal ruin. These traumatic childhood memories left a lasting impact on Nathanael's perception of Coppelius as a grotesque and ghostly monster who brings destruction wherever he appears.

Behavioral: Coppelius's behavior is shrouded in mystery and ambiguity throughout the novel. Nathanael's recollection of Coppelius's visit to his father's study when he was a child is filled with nightmarish elements. According to Nathanael's account, Coppelius attempted to harm him by throwing glowing embers into his eyes, and only the intervention of Nathanael's father saved him from further harm. After that incident, Coppelius disappeared for over a year and then resurfaced one last time, leading to a tragic explosion in Nathanael's father's study, resulting in the father's death.

Social: Coppelius seems to have a mysterious and elusive presence. He appears intermittently in Nathanael's life, first as a frequent guest in Nathanael's childhood home and then later as the Wetterglashändler Coppola, a weather glass seller. However, the true identity of Coppelius remains a subject of uncertainty and fear for Nathanael, as he struggles to distinguish between reality and his childhood terrors.

Key Actions:

Childhood trauma: As a child, Nathanael experienced a traumatic encounter with Coppelius, whom he believed to be the Sandman. This encounter left him with deep-seated fears and nightmares that continued to haunt him into adulthood.

Connection to Coppola: As a student in G., Nathanael believes he recognizes Coppelius in the Wetterglashändler Coppola. This connection reignites his childhood fears and anxieties, leading to a series of distressing events in his life.

Role in Olimpia's creation: The novel hints at Coppelius's involvement in the creation of the mechanical automaton, Olimpia, which captivates and ensnares Nathanael's imagination. Coppelius's relationship with Professor Spalanzani and his role in the events surrounding Olimpia remain ambiguous but contribute to the story's uncanny atmosphere.

Final encounter: Towards the end of the story, Coppelius reappears as Nathanael reaches a state of madness induced by Coppola's pocket telescope. As Nathanael attempts to push Clara from the Rat Tower, Coppelius emerges from the crowd and seems to take pleasure in the unfolding tragedy. After Nathanael's fatal fall, Coppelius disappears once more, leaving a sense of mystery and darkness in his wake.

Advocate Coppelius serves as a symbol of fear, trauma, and the uncanny in Nathanael's life.

Physical: Giuseppe Coppola is described as a weather glass seller who appears multiple times to Nathanael. His appearance is initially different from the figure of Advocate Coppelius, but Nathanael becomes unsure as he starts to notice resemblances between them. Coppola has a wide mouth that often twists into an ugly smile, and Nathanael finds certain facial features reminiscent of the sinister Coppelius. However, as a weather glass seller, Coppola dresses differently, and his appearance is influenced by his profession.

Mental: Coppola's mental state remains ambiguous throughout the story. He appears to be a seller of weather glasses and other optical instruments, suggesting that he is a harmless tradesman. However, Nathanael's perception of him is colored by his traumatic childhood experiences involving Coppelius. Nathanael's mind becomes unhinged, and he struggles to distinguish between reality and his own fears, leading to confusion and paranoia surrounding Coppola's identity.

Behavioral: Coppola's behavior appears innocuous at first as he sells weather glasses and optical instruments to Nathanael. However, Nathanael's perception of him is clouded by his traumatic memories of Advocate Coppelius, whom he believes to be the Sandman responsible for his father's death. Nathanael experiences moments of terror and delusion when encountering Coppola, as he starts to question whether Coppola might be Coppelius in disguise.

Social: Coppola seems to be a stranger to Nathanael's social circle in G. He presents himself as a simple weather glass seller and interacts with Nathanael in that capacity. There is no indication that Coppola has a close social network or connections beyond his interactions with Nathanael.

Key Actions:

Appearance and initial encounters: Coppola first appears at Nathanael's door as a weather glass seller, offering his wares. Nathanael is deeply disturbed by his presence, as he believes Coppola to be a doppelgänger of the sinister Advocate Coppelius from his childhood memories.

Sale of the pocket telescope: During one of Coppola's visits, he sells Nathanael a pocket telescope. Nathanael's experience with the telescope leads to a heightened state of delusion, causing him to perceive the mechanical automaton Olimpia as a living being.

Involvement in the conflict over Olimpia: As Nathanael becomes obsessed with Olimpia, he decides to ask for her hand in marriage. However, he encounters Professor Spalanzani and Coppola engaged in a heated argument over Olimpia. Coppola's true identity is further questioned when he speaks with Coppelius's voice during the altercation, reinforcing Nathanael's fears and suspicions.

He is fond of telling wondrous stories to his children during family evenings in his study, which Nathanael cherishes.

His mental state seems to fluctuate between moments of warmth and joy with his family and moments of introversion and contemplation.

Behavioral: Nathanael's father is portrayed as a devoted family man who enjoys spending time with his children. He engages in storytelling, and his enthusiasm during these moments leads to humorous incidents like his pipe frequently going out, requiring Nathanael's assistance to relight it.
